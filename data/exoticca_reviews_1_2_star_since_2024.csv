2025-09-28,N/A,Exoticca no response once again,"Dear Exotica,It has now been almost another week, and I am deeply concerned that I have still not received a proper response to my previous complaint. I must remind you that during one of your trips, I was left abandoned at the border between Botswana and Zimbabwe.This was a serious incident that not only caused me considerable distress and inconvenience, but also raised serious questions about the safety and reliability of your services. While I have repeatedly been promised a reply, all I have received so far are empty assurances with no actual resolution.Such treatment is unacceptable. I expect a full explanation for what happened, an official apology, and appropriate compensation for the ordeal I endured. I request that you provide me with a clear and substantive response within the next 7 days. If I do not hear back within this timeframe, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to the relevant consumer protection authorities and consider making my experience public.I trust you will take this matter seriously and respond without further delay. My booking reference once again as you asked for this every time and still don’t respond is.￼UK-EX2025337498Sincerely,Philip Wade"
2025-09-27,N/A,Screwed and on your own,We went to Portugal with Exoticca.Overall this was our most difficult trip ever.Started out with using their airlines. They purchase the cheapest bulk fare they can get. You pay for all baggage and seats. The fare is not upgradable. They do not help with seat selection. I tried for 9 months to get a seat on the last leg only to finally secure one at check in. They told me to submit a form to help get seat selections but then came back with you need to contact the airline. Now as far as the actual trip the accommodations were very standard and we were charged a local tax that the hotel up charges.The description in the itinerary isn’t even close to the actual experience. The first day we had passengers in tears. It’s a marathon not a tour. Our guide had difficulty because what they call small group turned out to be 41 people. The group had sick folks aboard which infected everyone(turns out we got Covid). The guide got so far ahead you lost track and the communication devise would lose reception. The guide apologized at the end saying he didn’t want to do the trip because of the size. The whole time you walked over uneven terrain and very fast pace. Most of the sights were accessible with the bus but Exoticca chooses to walk. If you wanted to stay in the bus and wait the driver denied you from staying. Some travelers just skipped the day altogether.The additional tours were less than inspiring. The fado dinner ended with us not even seeing the main singer and I can’t say anything good about the food.The trip home was a nightmare because the use of Iberia Air which could not book us through to our final destination. So we had to make many additional steps that were very difficult at bad times of the night.
2025-09-27,N/A,I will not recommend this trip to…,"I will not recommend this trip to anyone, all the places your are taking are either the cheapest area or a place to sale stuff.  We have three tour guides, one in each city, the only one that you can clearly understand is the one in Beijing.  The Great Wall of China was nothing great about, I was not aware there are different parts of the wall and the one we were taken to was just stairs, nothing like you see in YouTube.  The Chinese medicine tour is just to sale over prime Chinese medication, the Jade tour is just 15 minutes talk about Jade and one hour and half of trying to sale you stuff. I will recommend to travel on your own and get a local guide that will help you negotiate price instead of having the one from Exoticca take you to every place they make a commission from."
2025-09-27,N/A,Review of Exoticca Balkans Tour,"Review of Exoticca Balkans TourThe positives first: this trip did deliver on seeing a wide stretch of the Balkans—Albania, Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro—in 11 days, covering about 800 miles. We saw breathtaking coastlines, majestic mountains, and many important historical sites. Our bus driver was outstanding, and the guide was very knowledgeable.Unfortunately, there were many issues that made this trip more frustrating than enjoyable. To start, one traveler in our group had her airline ticket issued with the wrong name, even though she submitted her passport information correctly. After days of trying to reach Exoticca, she was told it was her fault and ended up paying an additional $1,500 for a new ticket.The biggest problem was the bus schedule. On multiple days we were on the bus for 9+ hours, not including traffic delays (one day stretched to 12 hours). This wasn’t just once—it was the norm to spend 7 or more hours on the bus daily. In some cases, we stayed overnight at hotels that required us to retrace the same traffic-heavy routes the next day, wasting hours. Cutting one of these destinations would have improved the trip immensely.The hotels were consistently below standard. While we expected them to be average, almost all had serious issues: broken toilets, showers too small to fit in, and one hotel so poor it should have been condemned—with exposed wires, pipes, no furnishings, and even bedbugs (which I discovered after waking up bitten). When I raised this, the guide shrugged it off, saying, “Always check your bed first.” That hotel should never be on the itinerary.The guide himself was knowledgeable but not helpful in preparing us for each day. We often only learned the destination name, not what activities or level of physical effort would be involved. For example, we wore light dresses in extreme heat only to discover we’d be climbing over 100 steep steps inside a cramped tower. Others skipped the experience entirely because they weren’t prepared. Opportunities like swimming at a beach, zip-lining, or kayaking were never explained in advance, and instead we were funneled into a group boat trip (30€ each) with little mention of alternatives. That ride included unlimited local alcohol (20–40 proof), which left one person ill and another dangerously drunk—hardly responsible group management.Even when we finally reached sites, our time there was extremely limited—usually just 30 minutes to an hour—before being herded back onto the bus. This was especially disappointing because Exoticca’s website promises no more than 25 people per group, but we had 35. The guide even admitted this is standard because smaller groups aren’t “profitable.”To sum up: the Balkans themselves are stunning, and we were grateful to see them. But Exoticca’s execution fell far short. Between the exhausting bus hours, subpar hotels (including one unsafe), lack of clear communication, and misleading information on their website, this trip was not what was advertised.My rating: 2 stars. The natural beauty saved it from being a 1-star trip, but Exoticca must make serious changes:Reduce bus time and cut a day from the itineraryBe transparent about group size and destinationsEnsure hotels meet minimum safety/cleanliness standardsProvide clear daily plans and options for activitiesThis trip is best suited for travelers who don’t mind sitting long hours on a bus with very little time to explore. For active travelers who want more than a glimpse of each stop, I cannot recommend it in its current form."
2025-09-26,N/A,Since booking the trip we have been…,Since booking the trip we have been unable to download the itinerary. I would lie to share with a couple of people who have expressed an interest in the trip.
2025-09-26,N/A,I paid for a superior package to Costa…don't do it!,"I paid for a superior package to Costa Rica.  A few days before you are due to leave you get your final itinerary.  I questioned it because only one hotel showed the category of superior.  They told me they can't guarantee superior in all areas.  Again I questioned it.  We were with a group of 8.  One other couple paid for superior and were upgraded at each hotel but nothing great. The other 2 couples were our neighbors at each hotel  The 2nd hotel Eco Arenal was disgusting.  Roaches in the room, can't flush toilet paper, ac didn't work which turned out to be a clogged disgusting filter.  Construction goin on outside our area.  Workers sitting outside our window yelling back and forth and coach buses parked out front!  I emailed them twice while on vacation as so upset and nothing was offered. I reached out to Exoticca again and was offered $200 credit and $200 credit for using them again.  I stated I don't want to use them again I want the difference refunded of what I paid extra.  Their final offer was $300 credit and $300 credit for another vacation with them that I would never use.  The superior for Costa Rica was a scam as now all of the hotels I stayed at are considered in the ""charm"" lowest category now.In response:  You don't mention mix of charm/superior when collecting payment.  I left 9/3 and yes got the final itinerary a few days before leaving and reached out asking why only one hotel was listed as superior (which now on your website is ""charm"") Taking payment for superior means you get superior hotels not changing it after the fact therefore a ""scam"".  I am tempted to do a chargeback as you all are not taking responsibility.  I want what I paid extra returned to my card which was almost $1000.  I do not want a credit for future travel with you.  I looked up the one hotel eco arenal and there are complaints from others about mold etc.  So if you are carefully checking your hotels, check harder. To charge almost 1000 more for superior vs charm and all get the same rooms at the same hotel, again a ""scam"".I want compensation for the price paid for superior which is almost $1000.   I do not want credit for future travel.  I thought I was clear but I will respond once again."
2025-09-26,N/A,Exotica don’t tell me about the…,"Exotica don’t tell me about the requirements to visit iguazu falls in Brazil and I ended up missing out ! and exotica couldn’t care less !!!No help, no support, no respond to emails and no refunds!They picked the worst  hotels (room full of spiders and Cockroach  toilets not working!! )The worst customer service ! It’s scary to trust them because they have no mercy and don’t respond if you need HELP !I didn’t hire exotica to make sure for me that I take my sunglasses to Brazil !!! but to make sure the crucial document of my trip is all set with me and I myself have applied for the visa before I go!!!Exotica by manipulation keep saying exotica don’t apply for visa Which is NOT my point !!!My point is exotica should’ve let me know about the crucial matter of the trip which is visa so I know I myself and I would’ve applied if exotica had told me !!!Exotica also bring up their terms and conditions to justify their lack of fulfillment !!! buyer be aware !!!"
2025-09-24,N/A,I have had £3000 pounds in Wallet…,I have had £3000 pounds in Wallet credits which say are valid until 29.08.2027.  However when I looked yesterday the credit has been reduced to £2000 and it still says valid until 29.08.2027.This is very dishonest practice with the agent saying £1000 gets reduced annually but it doesn't say that on the wallet value.  Unfortunately there is no where to add the screen shot.I know it was there a couple of weeks ago as I was looking at booking a holiday with a friend.I am tired of dishonest advertising!
2025-09-24,N/A,Too many stopover cheap flights,"Overall booking was ok. However communication is not great. We didn't get all the flight information until very late. And some stopover flights even within south America. Especially one flight from iguazu to Rio is only 2 hours of total time, and we have to stop over to another stop. The amount of money we paid should be enough to justify a nonstop flight for a 2 hours trip. There is already a lot take off and landing."
2025-09-24,N/A,Customer service fail,"We have a booked vacation to Norway and do not have flight info or even seats! It is 9/23/25 our trip is for 11/11/25. No flights so no seats. This was supposed to be a ""romantic getaway"" put to gether by a supposed romantic vacation expert. Now the stress of not having flights, and if last minute we get them no upgrade options and the chance we will be in random seats!We started the proces 6 months ago to NOT have to be stressed out about it. I've reached out to Christina L. Who has been the least helpful, not resppnding to emails, doubt she even has a clue."
2025-09-23,N/A,Exotica no response,"Dear Exotica Team,I am writing to follow up on a serious matter that I reported over three weeks ago, regarding my recent trip to South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana.As I previously mentioned, during our journey my daughter, my two granddaughters, and I were left stranded at the Zimbabwe–Botswana border by our travel guide. We were abandoned in the heat with no phone signal or means of contacting anyone for assistance. This experience was both distressing and unacceptable.At the time, I was assured that the matter would be looked into and that I would receive a response. However, despite the seriousness of the situation, I have yet to hear back from you.I would appreciate an urgent update on the outcome of your investigation and the steps you will be taking to address this matter. As a customer, I trusted your company to ensure the safety and wellbeing of my family during our travels, and I am deeply disappointed that such an incident occurred without follow-up. My booking reference EX-UK2025337498"
2025-09-22,N/A,Absolutely terrible customer service,Their customer service has to be considered one of the worst. Trying to get help is simply brutal. Hours of wait time on their chat. Forget about phone responses. We have used them before. We (the 12 of us who booked them last time) liked what they did for us. But I can’t take the poor service. I am trying to get answers for our booked trip to Italy and I might as well be speaking to the wall.  We were planning to book a Nile river cruise with them. As I am still waiting for some type of chat response we  agreed to look elsewhere. It really is just brutal. And a planned trip to South Africa in May is also off the table. There are other companies we know we can rely on. I will never go back to them again.
2025-09-25,N/A,I’ve got a trip booked and CANNOT get…,"I’ve got a trip booked and CANNOT get in touch with anyone at Exoticca. Just like the answers we can all see here… cut & paste answers. My flights were changed by the carrier and I’d like to choose my seats. Can’t do it because Exoticca booked the trip!Update:I now know that Exoticca cares more about reviews on TrustPilot than their customers. I got a response from this, not yet (if at all) the response I need, but a responseUpdate #224 more hours have passed with nothing from Exoticca except excuses.Update #3.Another day has passed without a resolution. I did get to chat with someone through the Exoticca app!  But that was a day ago and ended with a promise of help from the “flight team” shortly.I’m not sure what’s so difficult about sharing the email address and phone number of the entity that booked the original flights so I can carry on.I’d drop the one star rating to zero if I could"
2025-09-22,N/A,First time using Exoticca tour and so…,First time using Exoticca tour and so far not happy with the outcome. I have fully paid the tour and still unable to get any response from customer service regarding my airline E-tkt or hotel confirmation.24/7 center put me on  hold several time for over an hour without connecting to Agent.Still waiting for my airline E-TKT.NOT a happy customer:-(
2025-09-22,N/A,For the sixth time now !!!!,"For the sixth time now we have been in touch with exoticca regarding our flights and each time they say they will be in touch within 5 days which never happens, they say wizzair have cancelled the 8.15 and we are now on the 3.10 our we were on the 10.45 home now were on the 7.25 home even though its available on wizzair?...we've just opened our itinery we were sent and it still shows the first flight details ? They are not the company they used to be..."
2025-09-22,N/A,I fully paid for my trip,"I fully paid for my trip, but unable to get answers. I used the WhatsApp chat to get hold of customer service and several times I anwai online more then an hour.I am still waiting to receive my airline E-TKT and airline confirmation number.This is the first time I am using your company, but so far I don’t have any good things to say about it"
2025-09-22,N/A,Terrible Follow Up,"NEW UPDATE. Exoticca must have an “automatic” reply because twice they responded with exactly the same, identical response but then they do not do anything about resolving the problem. I am not playing that game anymore. I already provided the information requested and never heard back .I spite of the fact that Exoticca said on this site that they were working on resolving the issues with my “booking” they never got back to me.I strongly discourage anyone from using this company, they are unprofessional and they do not follow up or resolve issues"
2025-09-20,N/A,Worst trip to Italy ever,"Worst trip to Italy ever. Our nightmare started since the day we booked this trip thru an agent over the phone. She never made us aware that the flights were low economy without seat selection and checked luggage. We ended up expending more money in seat and checked luggage fees. The hotel in Rome was a closet size smelly room with the shower head was broken. We were most of the time travelling by bus visiting cities in a hurry. and little time to know the their surroundings. Our return flight was cancelled. Exoticca was never helpful with our request in helping us with a alternative flight. We had to do it ourselves at Venice airport. When you contact Exoticca, you just receive a robo-autogenerated response with a referral number."
2025-09-19,N/A,Can not get a person on the phone,"Can not get a person on the phone. Even the Emergency line is terrible, no one answersNot sure I would ever use Exoticca again , for this reason alone. They need to have people to answer telephone's."
2025-09-19,N/A,No common sense travel agents,"We booked a 16 day trip with Exoticca.  They fail to tell us that checked-in baggage is not included.  Talk about zero common sense for their customer service team.Then when I realised it was not included and called them up, ""oh we don't manage that, you need to go to BA"".  Totally unhelpful from start to finish.I call BA and can't do it until the airport.  Part of the reason of using companies like this is to make our lives easier, not more complicated.Mercury Travel far, far better than this."
2025-09-19,N/A,After I fully paid for the vacation…,"After I fully paid for the vacation package, o was informed a day later that my flights are not available,  how could that be? My package was confirmed and successfully submitted with confirmation. Now I was given 24 hours norice through the email to take different flights, not giving me the total duration of outgoing and return home. I have never witnessed such practices by any travel institutions so far, im very disappointed with the service provided to me."
2025-09-18,N/A,The company is using unfair practices…,"The company is using unfair practices with total disregard for customers. Just read carefully their policy - DO NOT SKIP! There are many complaints everywhere. My family has lost $3,800 without any compensation. Their website was not updated as well. Just imagine that you book and pay for flights, but get the itinerary for different flights (with two layovers). Their own mistake is not considered at all. If you want to change ANYTHING, you have to pay a hefty fee. The company is headquartered in Spain. They don't care about your potential problems that could happen during a trip. I just saw a recent complaint on Reddit. STAY AWAY!"
2025-09-11,N/A,I couldn’t apply the £99 cancellation…,I couldn’t apply the £99 cancellation to the booking.  Apparently has to be done at start of booking. Couldn’t be applied later.
2025-09-10,N/A,Don’t use Exoticca,While on our trip to Chobee National Park ￼ Botswana from Zimbabwe myself my daughter and two granddaughters one of which is 14 were abandoned border we came out of passport control to find no one in the car park. I’ll go and the mini bus had already left. There was no one else at the border at that time we were abandoned and to make matters worse that we had no phone signal lucky enough I was able to join onto some free Wi-Fi and able to contact the operator with WhatsApp who we were with through exoticca told him our situation he said leave it with me. I’ll call you back still waiting for that call today. we had to wait stranded at the border with nobody for 30 minutes until another tour guide found us a ride to the place the meet up place in Botswana where we found the group which we are travelling with we’re still sat therewaiting for a boat. i’ve been trying to contact exoticca Ikee since I’ve arrived home message after message but no reply to text replies in Spanish which I don’t speak because I’m English so ￼I advise people out there never to use exoticca one of the worst operators I have ever been with
2025-09-10,N/A,TRICKSTERS,I received an email from exoticca. I clicked on the unsubscribe icon several times during the day. An error message appeared every time. I telephoned exoticca. I was connected and on hold for over 35 minutes. I was told that as I do not have a booking I would have to go to the website and use the chat contact there. This I did and the chat bot responded that as I did not have a booking nothing could be done. Tricksters
2025-09-09,N/A,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service ever.  We leave tomorrow, had a last minute flight question.  Waited on hold for an hour (after dialing the ""emergency""number) and was basically told ""tough luck - hope you don't miss your connection"".  How is this company even in business?  Had we not already spent several thousand dollars on this trip, I would cancel immediately."
2025-09-10,N/A,I had a terrible experience trying to…,"I had a terrible experience trying to book a trip to Egypt which I ended up canceling due to the flaky agent Melina. She kept quoting me different prices even though I basically had done all the booking on line so I knew the costs but had questions. She quoted me over $300 for travel insurance when Exoticca offers a flex plan for $99, she would not return calls or emails, she was incredible unprofessional and inept! I tried talking to somebody else somebody named Milo but he refused to talk to me he said I needed to talk to Melina. I also asked him to transfer me to a supervisor but he openly refused. I had never dealt with a Travel Agency with such business practices. I would not deal with them because of their customer service or lack ofExotica has NOT contacted me even though I provided my email,phone number and the ONLY reference number Melina, the Exotica agent provided me. The trip was Egypt in 9 days departing February 2, 2025. Booking number 16913887. After my distrastrous encounter with both Milo and Melina I cancelled right before paying for the trip. Do NOT recommend this company"
2025-09-09,N/A,Disappointed,Just right after I purchased my package with a 5% discount the price drops by 500$. Its not even 24hrs since my purchase. When i called they say they cant do anything about it. I honestly feel scammed. I expected better.
2025-09-09,N/A,Flight change not shown in exoticca account after 5 e mails,"Once again exoticca have failed to update our account to show the new flight time after 5 attempts ??? Wizzair cancelled the 8.15am flight from Luton and exoticcas flight team asked us to choose a new flight which we responded to the e mail on 5 separate occasions with the 3.10pm  flight yet the account still shows 8.15, till we have the correct flight times were unable to charge our parking arrangements...what's so difficult ??"
2025-09-09,N/A,Price drop within 24 hrs of purchase.,"Not even 24hrs after you book from them, the price drops. And when i say there is a price drop, its a drastic one. Its like they monitor your searches and keep the price increased while always saying lowest price possible. Makes 0 sense. It still says the same 45% discount. This clearly shows that they play with the prices and are not a fair system. When you call their customer service, not very helpful.  Was not able to talk to a manager. I dont think i will ever use exotica again."
2025-09-07,N/A,customer service lacking severely,"I was trying to book a trip and nobody would take my payment. They put me on hold for a person presumably who was helping me, but I never actually ever spoke with anyone who helped me. Ridiculous to assign me to someone and nobody else can help me.Phone wait times nearing 1 hour is not good. Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come from Exoticca."
2025-09-06,N/A,Shut down this scam company!,"For sales they pick up the phone in a few minutes, for customer service you have to wait over a hour to speak to anyone. What a scam of a company. They only care about making money quickly and then don’t care about customer satisfaction. The CEO is clearly an idiot!"
2025-09-05,N/A,The tour guide was terrible; Tour was mediocre at best!  Avoid Exoticca!!!a,"The tour guide was terrible, couldn't speak English clearly, changed plans and meeting information regularly, left my wife and I one time while we waited for him to complete one of his long and difficult walks. (finally saw him 2+ hours later after leaving us behind) My recommendation: hire a better tour guide who does not frequently criticize Americans, Germans, Asians and other minorities or nationalities. Avoid the 9-day tour of Switzerland.  Nice country but not worth the cost and the aggravation!  This tour was not fun and walking was hard for elderly people - so much so that my wife didn't want to do the walking tour the last two days because of all the steps and walking that our tour guide wanted us to do!"
2025-09-08,N/A,Likes and dislikes,"Likes: The advisers we talked to are very patient in explaining the itineraries, so that helped in our decision to book.Dislikes: Your website advertised so many discounted tours, similar tours but when it cam to our preferred dates, the discount doesn't apply. Also, to exclude airfares, it only saved $100 per person. We wanted to fly business class but you don't offer that! I think the discounts advertised are deceiving!9/08/2025 update:Dislikes: Received a reply and they declined both appeals. I understand first denial since we have a specific date for travel due to this being a destination wedding so were not flexible with dates but to deny my brother's referral code (which was ignored the day of booking) and so I submitted it the next day for consideration, they said we did not book through that link but how could we? We were depending on the live agent to help us though the booking process and I did mention to Melina about the referral. They are being petty to save $100 on a $6,500 trip! Petty, petty, petty! Too bad as I have many friends and relatives that are potential referrals!"
2025-09-03,N/A,Awful chat experience,"Awful chat experience. AI worked well, but when n I was transferred to a live agent thee wait between responses was so damn long. I spent over 2 hrs and STILL did not get the answer I was looking for"
2025-09-03,N/A,Very Unpleasant Experience,"We booked a London Town & City of Light by Eurostar trip on Aug 30, 2025. The sales rep (Matt) was not responsive to our requests. He twice promised to call us back with the results, but never called back, even to inform us one way or the other. We had to constantly call him to get the answers.He offered a 5% discount, but used our existing travel credit from another trip without informing us, calling it a discount he was offering.This unpleasant experience made me rethink another trip I was planning to book with Exoticca."
2025-09-03,N/A,The suffering,"I decided to book with them because I wanted professional service.  Now theyhave changed all the hotels just 3 weeks before the trip and this does not work!  We spend 2 days in Amboseli, but somehow, according to them we sleep 700km away from the Park!!!!!  As I pointed that out they said that the hotels are already booked, and cannot be changed!We booked a Ballonflight in Masai Mara, but somehow...sleep that night in Nairobi...That is a 5 hour Drive!!!  To be there at 3 AM!!!!  Worst Customer Service ever!!!Oh and you DO NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK"
2025-09-03,N/A,We booked as a group of 5 on a Peru…,"We booked as a group of 5 on a Peru trip.  When we arrived, we found that one person was booked on a different inner-country flight and we were unable to get them to change to allow us all to travel together."
2025-09-01,N/A,I am extremely unhappy about having to…,I am extremely unhappy about having to send a scan of my passport to rectify an entry error made by the sales agent when all that was required was to change the gender - nothing else.
2025-08-29,N/A,Beware of your Wallet Funds,I had a very bad experience. Previously I was told that I will be getting a 10% cash discount which was agreed but saw my Wallet being wiped off.Customer service was horrible and very difficult to explain and understand.Had to shuffle 2 -3 days to finalize the purchase.
2025-08-28,N/A,Poor customer service!,"Manuel started off being very helpful!  I told him to hold the quote till the next day after discussing with my husband. Only to find out, he did NOT mention about the $99 insurance when I called the next day.  Not cool!  I always get travel insurance. He said he would have to redo the order adding the insurance and will not have my direct flight I selected.  I asked to speak to a manager and he refused to transfer me and said they will say the same thing and nothing can be done.  That is a lie, managers can override the system! Awful customer service! What happened to him overnight? He was totally different from the day before."
2025-08-27,N/A,Poor Customer Service,"This is our 2nd trip we have booked with Exoticca. Our last trip we booked our own flights so were able to go ahead and book our seats immediately we had a PNR Code.I was told by the agent this time that as soon as I had paid the deposit and got a PNR code I would be able to go into the flight website and again book my seats but this is not the case and after contacting customer services by phone, email and chat many times over the last three weeks I am still waiting for this to be resolved."
2025-08-26,N/A,No one responds,Still trying to reach someone to correct misspelling of one of our groups name. Wait time for customer service call is over 90 minutes. Chat bot cannot resolve and filed online case with no response. Person has not received any help even though fully paid.
2025-09-02,N/A,Re my previous review with regards to…,"Re my previous review with regards to flight changes, well we were told the 8 15 am from Luton to tirana had been cancelled by wizzair and we were to select a new outbound flight, after nearly a hour to get through we selected the 3.10pm flight which has caused great Inconvenience yet our account still shows 8.15am flights, such Inconvenience also we raised a complaint which upto now no one has been in touch, so this will mean another hour to speak to someone who will tell you it's been done when it's not....be mindful when booking it's not worth the grief I've sent off the booking ref as requested but again heard nothing REF UK-EX2024299341, still not updated our outbound flight in the exoticca account to the 3.10pm flight it still shows 8.15am so we cannot ammend parking till this is done...its the simplest resolution to this problem why hasn't this been done...p.s its a bad state of affairs when the only way to get in touch with exoticca is via Trustpilot 🤔"
2025-08-23,N/A,Really bad experience,"Really bad experience - do not book through this company. Change things last minute - flights not convenient with huge stop overs. Read the reddit forums about people's poor experiences with them - they are cheap for a reason and tbh you'll probably end up being inconvenienced by them to the point where any saving is not worthwhile.Hotels are changed and not equivalent - they claim they are..... But are often of poor quality even if you have paid for superior.Absolutely not worthwhile, book independently as you have choice and flexibility.Company is also rude and unhelpful if you try to communicate about the changes.Please avoid."
2025-08-23,N/A,Six time customer very un-impressed,"I have been a 6 time customer of Exoticca. I am well aware that they are extremely difficulty to get hold of if you have a problem or enquiry, especially if you are actually on vacation. They can take weeks to respond to any issue and offer little in the way of contacts in an emergency situation. I forgave all of that as I travelled with them as they were generally well organized and delivered as promised... until they didn't and from there I encountered my own issues, many of which I didn't even bother reporting i.e. overdue pickup at locations, drop offs at wrong hotels, wrong flight information etc. They are based in Spain and so contacting them from elsewhere is almost impossible so don't even try if you need a speedy response. I recently booked a trip to India. I followed their instructions  and paid the initial deposit etc and then applied for my tourist visa and there my problems began. Lo and behold,the Indian government had suspended issuing tourist visas to Canadian passport holders due to on-going political disputes! I had applied online to the Consulate, in person at their proxy offices in Mississauga, Ontario and by eVisa application only to be denied a tourist visa at all levels by the Indian government. Thus, I could not travel and advised Exoticca of the problem and requested a cancellation and refund. None of this information had been posted on the Exoticca website when they offered the trip as to Indian visas being denied to Canadian passport holders but yet they continued to offer the trip and then pocket the money of those who had been refused tourist Visas. They were not sympathetic to say the least and refused a refund or credit and it was essentially ""your loss, you didn't check the fine print"". I requested a chargeback on my credit card payment and that was ultimately refused by an aribtrator so I am out over $2600.Bottom line, for this India trip, Canadian passport holders be well advised to check on the current visa status. Exoticca is fine when eveything is going well but be very aware of what may happen when things come off the rails and that they will not be there to support you."
2025-08-22,N/A,"Take Care Booking with Exoticca , poor comms & hidden costs.","Booked a Portugal Trip with Exoticca, using Portuguese airline TAP.  Hard to find any advice on Check-in or Extra Baggage. Went to TAP website and entered the Exoticca provided Booking Reference , not accepted. Contacted Exoticca to try to sort out the issue. Exoticca suggested using my tickect numbers , which they then provided. Neither ticket number accepted by TAP.  Asked Exoticca about extra baggage , they said they would send my enquiry to their 'Flight department' and that they would email me back (sometime?). Never found it so difficult to progress a simple process. Contacted TAP by telephone they said two items of Hold Luggage would be £120 each way , yep, £240 for two bags return.  Not surprised Exoticca are not very 'upfront' with costs. A bad start , lets hope the trip is a lot better!Part Two (post reply) You see what I mean?  A reply that still cannot answer a simple question about extra baggage!  Painful."
2025-08-21,N/A,No news from our complaint,No news from our complaint! They response to our review that they are going to contact however no answer right now. It is incredible! Not recommended at all.
2025-08-19,N/A,Bad customer support support... No response.,"We booked a trip, and we have questions, and we cannot have anyone from customer support answers the multiple calls we made over multiple days and different times.  This is Not Acceptable service."
2025-08-19,N/A,Extremely Disappointed with Exoticca,"Extremely Disappointed with Exoticca – Poor Planning, Terrible Support, and Not Worth the PriceWe recently booked a multi-person trip through Exoticca, we're a group of four spending nearly $20,000 with the expectation of a smooth, well-managed travel experience. Unfortunately, what we received was anything but.While the local tour operators in Chile were fantastic—punctual, professional, and knowledgeable—the portions of the trip directly handled by Exoticca were riddled with issues. Here's what went wrong:1. Poor Hotel Room AssignmentsDespite clear booking instructions, two out of three hotel stays had rooms with two single beds instead of one bed per couple. This is a basic accommodation request, and for a travel company selling ""premium experiences,"" it’s hard to understand how this was missed.2. Rock-Bottom Flight BookingsAll flights were booked in the lowest fare class. We couldn’t select seats—not even at our own expense—which left us scattered across the plane in middle seats on every leg of the trip. For a high-cost tour package, this level of service is inexcusable.3. Mishandled Flight CancellationA major issue arose when our internal flight from Calama to Santiago was cancelled without notice. The Exoticca app showed no updates, and their support team was unaware of the cancellation. We were asked to “imagine the worst-case scenario” by a rep who provided no useful help. We ended up rebooking directly with the airline (at no extra cost, thanks to Sky Airline) and arranging our own airport transfer.Exoticca only followed up after we had solved the problem ourselves, offering no real support when it mattered.4. Poor Logistics to Puerto NatalesThe journey to Puerto Natales involved an 11-hour ordeal (a 5-hour flight with layover plus a 3-hour bus ride). With better planning, this could have been made far more efficient. The exhausting travel time seemed unnecessary and avoidable.5. Ineffective Scheduling in Puerto NatalesWe were given a free day in Puerto Natales on a Sunday, when virtually everything in town—shops, cafés, and even the local museum—was closed. A guided tour could easily have been scheduled on this day instead, making better use of our time. This kind of oversight shows a serious lack of on-the-ground planning.6. Return Flights: More of the SameOn our return flights, we again found ourselves booked into the lowest-tier fare with no way to sit with our travel companions. After everything we’d already dealt with, this was a frustrating end to an already disappointing experience.7. Poor Customer ServiceThroughout the trip, Exoticca's customer service was dismissive and unhelpful. When things went wrong, they took no responsibility and offered no meaningful assistance. All problem-solving fell to us—the travelers—defeating the point of using a tour company in the first place.Bottom line: This was a very expensive trip, and Exoticca failed to deliver a product or service worthy of the cost. Their lack of organization, poor planning, and lack of customer support made what should have been a once-in-a-lifetime adventure an ongoing source of stress and frustration.I would strongly advise others to think twice before booking with Exoticca. While the destinations were beautiful and local partners competent, Exoticca’s role in the trip fell far below expectations.I have reached out to exoticca through filing a complaint on their website and requesting a call back by a manager or someone who has the authority to make decisions as customer reps can't and tend to only open cases. I have a case number and it's been almost a week and haven't heard back. When I was looking to book with them they'd call me two to three times a day, but after the payment was made reaching a solution with them is near impossible especially when we had an emergency.-----Here's the case number: 03934208. I'll update this thread if a resolution is provided by Exoticca because as of this moment Exoticca has responded these standard responses to members of the group that submitted the complaints but never followed up. It seems just to make it appear they'll address the issues but we don't hear back. I'll keep updating as I hear back."
2025-08-26,N/A,Company booked me going in and out of two different airports for my trip,"Second response:  lies. I didn’t book flights, and was informed less than 30 Days left what the flights were, so too late to change. Very poor service and now trying to make it my fault.Response to Exotica’s response:  not sure why your screw up would cost me more money.  Why would any company think its ok to not book a trip in and out of same airport is beyond me.  And it isn’t just the phone and this isn’t first instance.  It’s by chat, email and phone.  Still no response.  They are severely understaffed in my opinion.  Not fair to customers nor is it fair to the staff answering phones.  Do better and don’t make excuses.Company booked me leaving out of another airport and returning to my home airport.  It is odd that my home airport has a flight arriving into connecting city at same time as booked flight .  Odd they didn’t book that.  Then trouble starts.  I’ve been on chat hold for over two hours and no one is there.  Been on, cust service hold 40 min with no one.  Got through to three sales agents and they just transfer me to the number for cust service  that no one answers.  Poor customer service service and can’t get problem fixed. Would rate zero stars for support"
2025-08-18,N/A,"I just booked with Exoticca, big mistake","I just booked with Exoticca for a 14 day tour to Egypt and Jordan.  I paid for upgraded airfare to business class.  After receiving confirmation of the flights I requested, I received a second notice, 24 hours later that my flights were not available.  Instead they want to book flights that get in at midnight and are “economy”.  I have tried 4 times to reach them by phone or chat.  The current wait time for a live agent is 155 minutes. I would not recommend this company because of the horrible customer support."
2025-08-17,N/A,"Do not use, cut corners, change flights, poor communication","My partner, initially booked a solo trip in early 2025 for a trip in September to South Africa and Zimbabwe. In May, we contacted Exoticca team to amend the booking to a joint reservation, with the understanding that we would be travelling together on the same flights, accommodation, and participating in the same itinerary. We were assured at the time that this would be arranged without issue.However, on Monday, 4 August, I received a notification from Airline indicating a change to my flight scheduled for 3 October. Upon reviewing the details, I discovered that I had been booked on different flights from my partner for both 3 October and 10 October. I immediately contacted their staff to rectify the error and was informed that corrective arrangements would be made.As of today’s date they have only resolved the flight on 3 October.  7 October remains outstanding, and no resolution has been provided.  They have not responded to a formal email complaint sent on 7 August, chat live takes a while to get through and telephone over 1 hour to speak with an advisor. This delay is unacceptable, particularly given the substantial financial investment involved. I was further disheartened to be informed during a call with their advisor on 7 August that my situation was not considered urgent, which I found wholly inappropriate under the circumstances."
2025-08-16,N/A,No help from Exotica during Air Canada flight disruption,"I am extremely disappointed that Exoticca has not been helpful or responsive after repeated requests for support following Air Canada’s cancellation of our flight today. We tried to reschedule directly with Air Canada, but when they couldn’t provide an alternative, they advised us to contact Exoticca as our booking agent. Despite several attempts, we have received no assistance.We urgently asked Exoticca to either:Secure an alternative flight that would get us to Lisbon in time to enjoy the trip we booked, orIssue a full refund.To date, they have failed to respond.What was meant to be a trip of a lifetime has quickly turned into a stressful and upsetting nightmare due to Exoticca’s lack of communication and accountability. As the booking agency responsible for this trip, they must provide a timely solution without further delay.We are extremely disappointed and frustrated by this horrible experience."
2025-08-14,N/A,After 6 previous tours with exoticca we…,"After 6 previous tours with exoticca we felt comfortable booking another as we have had some great experiences however this latest tour ( dreamy road trip through the balkans)  in October is turning into a stressful situation as 3 times now they have changed our flights  the latest being from 8 in the morning to 5 in the evening, we have parking booked and we have arranged something in Tirana which we will have to try and rearrange, we called exoticca and were told a flight specialist would call us that was a week ago and no one has called so again we will have to wait nearly an hour on the phone to speak to someone, it's a shocking way to treat loyal customers but it appears they don't care...be wary"
2025-08-13,N/A,"Poor Customer Service, No complaints Procedure and do not communicate","I booked a Jordan Holiday in January 2025 - my first experience with Exoticca... Booking was fine, staff were friendly. Obviously there has been a few concerns regarding the destination due to the conflict, but we were confident to continue with the holiday due to FCDO current advice.In June we were notified of a change to our flight from Luton, it was not significant and we accepted it. We then received notification that the flight had been cancelled and were offered a flight from Stanstead which resulted in the loss of our final day and first evening. On a 7 night holiday we felt this was significant and attempted to contact customer service. I will simply bullet what follows:1. In excess of 1 hour waits to speak to an operative on every occasion2. Poor solutions offered which included 7.5 lay over on a flight that was booked as less than 6 hours3. When we sought to work flexibly - and identified a flight (that we could have booked as part of our original booking and is with the same airline offered at Stanstead) Exoticca sought to charge 1/3 more (£1200 versus an advertised £850 for 2 flights) than the advertised flight costs and offset £0 of the cancelled flights monies I had paid.4. Stating verbally that you cannot speak to a manager.5. Providing incorrect information - we were told the wrong flight details as part of the 'resolution process' which I had to then research to confirm they did not exist with the 'customer service operative quite condescending until he was proven to be wrong.6. A response time of 5 days to most email communication7. A ceasing in communication when asking for the complaints procedure8. A failure to respond to my request for a refund - under the 'Significant Change' (Flight changes over 4+ hours) which is required to be processed in 14 days.9. Failure to provide any details of independent ombudsman services.Exoticca feel that offering a credit to your wallet is a resolution, but simply I understand these offer cheap solutions to 'Bucket List' holidays, this was not my motivator, it was the tour itself which we took every option to upgrade, however if they cannot deliver simple customer service no holiday with them will ever be superior.Currently I am supposed to be going on my anniversary trip on 6th September (We would simply have booked somewhere else if we had received our refund) with no resolution and no communication now!So if you want peace of mind, customer service and communication take a look at the itinerary, take ideas and book with an agent that will provide these basic services and work in line with UK consumer rights."
2025-08-18,N/A,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Seriously, find any other company to help you plan your trip. These guys will cut corners left and right to profit off of you. Flights - literally the cheapest. I'm not talking about no food on the flight option only but also the lowest class seats meaning you get middle seats only. If you're a group, you sit apart each in a middle seat on your own even at a 9+ hour flight. Oh and let's ignore the fact that they messed up our itinerary on the app vs what's actually happening. By total fluke we discovered our flight had changed just because I decided to check in early for a domestic flight which we don't have to and not because Exoticca told us or updated our details.Sure, let's ignore flights and talk about the hotels. We are a queer couple and booked together. We had MULTIPLE conversations with them and mentioned we were partners. We showed up to all three hotels with seperate beds at a country that had legalized it YEARSSS ago.I could go on and on like not telling us that on Sunday everything would be closed in a city we were in (literally even the museum and souvenir stores). We basically sat in the hotel all day and wasted a day and a half waiting for a 3 hour bus to take us to an airport when there was an airport an hour away we could have taken. I'm telling you, any chance to cut corners they will do. Save yourself the pain and your money and AVOID!!!Update: they haven't responded to my concerns and claim... As expected."
2025-08-12,N/A,Worst customer service and poor online…,"Worst customer service and poor online support.Trying to get in touch with someone in customer service for days, waiting for hours days after days on phone for small queries- yet no response. I  am not sure anything wrong with this travel company as I can see everyone is complaining same thing and this people are not bothering to sort out their customer service. I have used this company for many years and never been so bad until recently.I  hope they should listen to the customers who are paying thousands of pounds are experiencing such misery and stress.Does anyone know how to get in touch with them in phone?"
2025-08-11,N/A,I have previously travelled with…,I have previously travelled with Exoticca and had a positive holiday experience but for further bookings it has been very difficult to communicate with themI have waited long periods for a agent on their chat line and given up and have sent emails and no acknowledgment or reply- it seems it is practically impossible to make a formal complaintCustomer service around the booking process seems very poor

2025-08-09,N/A,Difficult to get hold of a travel agent or customer service,I have been trying to reach or talk to a travel agent or customer service for 2 consecutive days now. I was put on hold for more than 4 hours until customer service closed. I tried to call early in the morning but it is the same they will put you on hold for hours. It is really frustrating and so disappointing.  I have tried using  the digital travel assistant but it doesn’t seem to work. I also filled up the Online form TWICE but also didn’t get response.and now it is the weekend and I have to wait until Monday to call them again
2025-08-08,N/A,Be very weary of booking a trip with Exoticca,"Be very weary of booking a trip with Exoticca. I have been in the travel industy over 20 years and Ive never had such a difficult time getting a hold of a department or agent. Their sales team will answer in just a few short rings. Obviously this makes them money, but when it comes to taking care of even the simplest of tasks - expect it to take weeks to get a response, if you get one at all. Their response time over email claims 5-8 days but in reality if you get a response its 2-3 weeks. Their chat wait time; 1hr and 56 minutes!! And dont expect to get anyone to actually answer the customer service line should you make a call. I even tried the sales line and having them transfer me (because they refuse to help with standing orders, only new orders). It makes no difference.Over the course of my interactions with Exoticca, I have consistently encountered conflicting information regarding my travel bookings. More concerning is the complete lack of reliable customer support. Repeated attempts to contact the company via phone, email, and live chat have gone unanswered or have resulted in delayed, unhelpful responses. In urgent situations, this unavailability has caused significant stress and uncertainty around my travel plans.This is not an isolated incident—each time I’ve dealt with Exoticca, their customer service has been among the worst I’ve experienced in the travel industry. Their inability to provide timely and consistent support raises serious concerns about their business practices and their suitability as a trusted travel provider.Travelers deserve transparency and access to support—especially when dealing with something as complex and time-sensitive as international travel."
2025-08-12,N/A,We did not receive the trip we signed…,"We did not receive the trip we signed up for as Exoticca made changes to our original travel plans that are not what we elected even tho they offered the plans to us originally.   Many phone calls with hour long waits to talk to a live person.  Purchased travel insurance saying you can cancel for any reason.  Finding that to not be the case as no resolution has been forthcoming.  Buyer be ware when purchasing from them as they are quick to take your money but unwilling to resolve any disputes.Your response states that someone from Exoticca is in contact with me, but I have NOT received any contact from Exoticca.I have reviewed all my Spam and inbox and there is No document from Exoticca.  Perhaps someone could reach out via phone call to confirm the address you are sending the information to."
2025-08-09,N/A,Exoticca is a thief,"Very poor after-sales service. Once you pay, no one picks up your phone at Exoticca. I waited for over 2 hours each time with no luck. I think they have an AI tool that recognizes new clients and those who have already paid and de-prioritizes existing client calls!!Exoticca when they reply to our complaints will write a standard line ""we send you an email and we are waiting for your reply and also clarified the matter"". That is a lie!! The matter is still unresolved. Their last email states that they are trying to find flights for all 6 members on one flight as our bookings are linked and will get back in 2-3 days. 3 days are gone and no response. They collect money upfront and you are on the hook!!! Finally, they will put all 6 of us on different flights and that was not what we signed for.On hindsight, I find that we should find local tour companies and book our own flights than paying Exoticca and get cheated."
2025-08-05,N/A,Deceitful company ruined my honeymoon,"I booked a vacation package with a travel agent by phone. He booked the wrong vacation package even though I specified which package I wanted. The agency was closed so I sent emails and followed up by phone yesterday. I received a response today saying that they cannot change my vacation package and could only offer a partial refund if I wanted to change it.Madrid, Andalusia, Valencia & BarcelonaSpain in 9 Days, 7 Nights in Destination - This is the vacation package I wanted.Self-Guided Tour of Madrid & BarcelonaSpain in 9 Days, 7 Nights in Destination - This is the one that was booked for me.Very different packages considering one is guided with 4 cities and the other is self-guided with only 2 cities. I specifically had the 4 city one in my account and told the agent that's the one I wanted. I know he was able to see it because he could see the flights I picked. I SPECIFICALLY said I did NOT want the self guided vacation package and I asked him to make sure that was not the one he was booking for me. He said it wasn't. When I get the itinerary in my email after paying, it showed the self-guided vacation package. Now they're saying they made no mistake and that was the package I picked and they can only give a partial refund if I would like to change it. This is the first and last time I book with deceitful company. This was supposed to be my honeymoon and now it's a nightmare."
2025-08-01,N/A,Do not book this company ever,"There is zero chance this company has a 4.4 rating without them artificially pumping their numbers. Their customer service number never gets answered.

All they wanted was my email and name and kept saying the system was wrong so they would get credit. This company is the most misran company. I have no idea how it stays in business. I had to change the name of the person outside of 60 days and the people told me you cant do that once you make final payment. Then at 45 days they said we hope you have a great trip but you are unable to switch names at 60 days and completely lied. Every time you ask for a manager magically, they dont exist. Will never book a trip with this company again.They gave me this reply - clearly they dont understand how to add. They remove 30 days to make it seem like they are in the right but cant add then close the case. So i had to reopen a case and show them their math is incorrect.Hello Christopher,Thank you for your response and for providing all the necessary details.We’ve carefully reviewed your request and checked whether the name change is possible.Your initial inquiry via chat was made on June 19, 2025, which leaves 46 days before your scheduled departure on September 2, 2025. Unfortunately, as the request was made after the 60-day cutoff, change penalties now apply.As a result, making the change would require a cancellation and rebooking, in line with our Terms and Conditions.This is why we are unable to proceed with a direct name change for the second passenger. If the request had been made at least 60 days prior to departure, a name change would have been possible through cancellation and rebooking without the associated penalties.We hope this clarifies the situation, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.Kind regards,"

I was on hold for over 35 minutes, and the online chat was unhelpful.I don’t know what to do, and this situation is causing me a great deal of stress and worry about the upcoming trip.

2025-07-17,N/A,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!,"Appalling service. Avoid this company at all costs . And read trip advisor. Wish we had before we had booked with them. There's dozens of bad reviews, similar to our findings.The whole trip was a car crash. The hotels were exceptionally poor. We refused to even stay in two out of the three. They were nothing short of disgusting.  Filthy, nappies on the floor, broken sunbeds, not even a 2 star resort. Just inhabitable. We booked different hotels off our own backs and stayed there.The trips were poor. Done as cheap as possible and stretch them out to call them day trips.Our transfer back to the airport didn't even turn up on the last day and we had to pay for a taxi to get there so we didn't miss our flights home.We are contacting trading standards becasue they advertise things that are completely miss sold. We have been told we have a good case for this too.Exoticca Call roxane Kirton for chatting this through"
2025-07-14,N/A,Not what it used to be,"We have been loyal customers of Exoticca for a number of years and have spent thousands of pounds with them. We had great experiences in the first few years but the last couple of trips have been littered with problems. Our trip to Peru contained a number of issues with the luggage and we were left out of pocket and to sort the issue ourselves - no help from Exoticca.Our most recent trip to Morocco was booked some time ago. We booked the holiday based on flight dates and times that worked for us. Exoticca sent an email to advise that the flights had changed and they were offering ones from a completely different airport! We’ve spent hours on the phone and live chat trying to get through to them. Emails go unanswered. They say they’ll look into things but never get back. We’re due to fly in less than 2 months and flights haven’t been sorted. We’ve been presented with an option that means we are spending less time at the destination and won’t receive the evening meal that we’ve paid for as a result. Totally not in accordance with what we expected when we booked. No recognition of this from Exoticca. They don’t care and in recent years, it’s clear that all they’re focused on is money and not providing great customer service and satisfaction. As someone who books a lot of holidays, they’ve now lost a once loyal customer. For future customers looking to book, their after service is shockingly poor and they book the most basic options on flights to save themselves money. Would advise you avoid based on my recent experience"

You can never get past the rep, wait times on hold are always more than 40 minutes - and there seems to be no way to escalate the issue."
2025-06-27,N/A,Poor customer service,"The trip was amazing - the customer service is horrible. After 2 months, we still haven't been refunded for a canceled flight. Delta reimbursed Exoticca within 7 days - but nothing has been reimbursed to us after needing to book a flight at our own expense on a different carrier."

However, the return flight from Quito was cancelled by the airline. Due to our schedules for work, we booked a return on another airline. We are still waiting for the return ticket refund from Exoticca. The airline reimbursed Exoticca."
2025-06-26,N/A,A whole lot wrong.,"Poor communication.Unprofessional.Extremely difficult to get to speak to a human.Promises not kept.Unreasonable cancellation policy.Follow-up from Exoticca answer.It took three weeks to actually speak to an agent.And the answer I received was useless since it did not  deal with any issue, just like the conversation with the agent.  Take the money and run!Why not reach out to me?  This would avoid a lot of frustration in trying to solve communication issues.Final thoughts—-after further numerous attempts to resolve the problem, my statements above stand.  I could never recommend this company.  Read the fine print of the contract very carefully."
2025-06-23,N/A,Regarding my recent trip to Greece…,"Regarding my recent trip to Greece through Exoticca on the following dates, May 11th - May 23rd, 2025.Although the islands of Santorini, Paros, and Mykonos were beautiful, I was very displeased with the following issues:- hotels in Athens, Boss Boutique Hotel and Breeze Boutique Hotel, were terrible. We had to wait until 3:00 pm to check in which caused a huge line up of guests arriving and only one receptionist to check in each guest. The elevators were extremely slow and small where only two people with their luggage could fit in it. Because they were so slow and line ups of people waiting, I took the stairs to my room which was on the 8th floor! The rooms were unimpressive as well. The hotels were located in a bad area that had prostitutes standing outside the building and homeless people sleeping or passed out around the outside of the hotel. My view from the Boss Boutique hotel looked onto a run down apartment building with garbage on the balconies.- Our tour guide for the visit to the Acropolis left us behind at the site after we were dealing with one member of my group who had an envelope containing her money/high speed ferry passes stolen from her purse. Thankfully she got it back from the woman who stole it. When we went back to the bus to return to our hotel, the bus had left. Therefore, we had to walk back to the hotel using the GPS on our cellphones.- The hotel in Kalambaka was unbelievably dirty and cringe worthy. I couldn't even shower because it was so old and dirty in the bathroom. The room smelled musty as well. The lights in the hallway would shut off if there was no movement which made it difficult to try and turn my rooms lights on when entering. There was also bugs in the room.- The hotel in Santorini was a little better, but I still wasn't happy with it. The beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable.- The hotel in Paros was clean, but my complaint for this hotel was our breakfast. It was brought to us in our rooms, in a basket which held 2 slices of dry bread, a juice box, butter, fruit, hard boiled egg. There was no toaster in the room to toast the bread. Unacceptable!!- Each hotel that we stayed at did not provide bottles of drinking water in the rooms.The hotel in Mykonos was beautiful. I finally felt like I was on a holiday, but it was only for two nights.I was very much looking forward to going Greece and I paid a lot of money for this trip.  I  was very disappointed with the lack of meals included (only breakfasts and one dinner) and no excursions planned on each island. It was left up to the individuals to pay extra for this. Two years ago I went to Ireland and paid pretty much the same price as Greece. For this trip we had high end hotels, all breakfasts included, all dinners included (except one night) and had a tour guide the entire time with planned excursions.I've reached out to Exoticca twice now, June 7th and June 22nd and haven't been contacted by customer support. Very displeased with Exoticca!!"
2025-06-23,N/A,I was browsing the trip to check prices…,"I was browsing the trip to check prices and compare with competitors. I sign up to email alert to see if anything else will be suggested ( planning trip in March 2026 ) after that I got 2 calls, voicemail and 2 WhatsApp messages as well as 2 more emails to finish my booking all in 1h time window sounds so desperate that I won’t use them just for this reason"
2025-06-24,N/A,Due to the war between Iran and Israel…,"Due to the war between Iran and Israel we canceled our trip to Turkey, because is not safe, they did not return us the money because they say that is safe to fly there.We all know it's not safe to go there, especially considering the radiation from the nuclear reactor explosions that have happened."
2025-06-21,N/A,Spent Greece trip with bed bug bites…,"Went on a 13 day Greece trip arranged by Exoticca. The rooms were downgraded. I had no tv, had to kill moths and woke up with my left leg full of bed bites. Had to get cream from the pharmacy and throw out my pjs. There was so much more that was terrible (breakfast, tour bus left without me) and rooms were so dirty. I have pictures. I told Exoticca and they didn’t care. I paid $6500 for this trip. I should have been refunded. They denied the small amount I was asking for the pain and suffering I endured."
2025-06-21,N/A,Exoticca service included bed bugs,"Contrary to the agreement, hotels were changed and I received sub-standard hotel rooms, I had to fight off moths, and worst of all, I was given a bed with bed bugs.  Needed to get cream from a pharmacist and buy new pjs.  Exoticca did not care.  I paid $6500 for this trip to Greece.  I asked Exoticca for a reasonable reimbursement.  Again, they did not care.  Now seeking legal advice for the pain and suffering I endured."
2025-06-20,N/A,Exoticca Flex Insurance Rip OFF,"We booked a family trip in 2023 to Jordan/Egypt and bought the Flex Insurance. One of the five travelers had to cancel and we were promised a $2720 travel credit good for 48 months. When we tried to used our travel credit, they were not able to locate/use it. Two customer representatives could find the travel credit, but could not apply to our current reservation; 3 others could not find it. My travel agent was on hold for over 3 hours with no success. I submitted two online customer request for assistances two months apart and no one ever contacted me although I got a acknowledgement that they received my online requests. My travel agent and I are extremely frustrated with situation. DO NOT BOOK ANY THING with EXOTICCA.  They will rip you off!"
2025-06-19,N/A,Horrible customer service!,"I had a wonderful time, but the customer service was horrible! Additionally, the flights and hotels did not meet my expectations. I bought the Luxury Package, and I was expecting to be in a better neighborhood. At the last hotel, they changed it, and it was in another country. As a result, I ended up paying for two visas, and I had to cross the border to participate in the tours.  I was writing WhatsApp messages to customer service to ask about my tours and pickup time, and they did not know and asked me to call the partners. Thank you to the hotel concierge who helped us communicate with the agency that was handling our tours. We were able to find out the pick-up time and the necessary information to continue with our trip."
2025-06-19,N/A,Do NOT book exoticaa add on tours,"Exotica is good for a good cost tour company and are great at that aspect. Do not pre purchase any add on tours with company.  I purchase an add on tour during booking and they messed uo and scheduled it on a day I was already on a tour on top of the mountain of Machu Pichu. As I was on the mountain with the tour part of the package I informed them in the morning there is no way I can be in 2 places at the same time. They were very slow on replies. They informed me they rescheduled the tour I booked for the next day. I informed then I cannot do that tour as I already have another tour booked. They said part of the terms and conditions they can move the dates and I have no say. If I dont show up that is on me and I still have to pay. Please only book through Trip advisor, get your guide, or viotour. Exoticca is good as a whole but do not trust their add on tours."
2025-07-12,N/A,Amazon and Galapagos Tour,"We enjoyed seeing the Amazon rainforest and the Galapagos island of San Cristobal AND meeting a wonderful group of fellow travelers on our Exoticca tour. However, this tour unfortunately, had some issues. First and foremost for us was their lodge in the rainforest, Suchipakari. We had large flying roaches in our room that we had to kill ourselves-about 7 every evening. Our last night was the worst, since they were hiding in the ceiling rafters. It was a nightmare to try and get them down from their hiding place so we could then kill them. The response we got about the roaches was ""well you're in the rainforest."" Our room was the only room that had roaches, so I guess they just didn't care. Besides that major problem, the tour was average. Some guides were great, especially Carlos from Quito to the Amazon, who took us to some great roadside stops and was an encyclopedia of information. Others, not so good or helpful. For example, our guide in the Galapagos kept talking about where to buy snorkeling tours. But, none of our group went snorkeling and she failed to mention all the non snorkeling activities that could be found on San Cristobal. Our hotel room on San Cristobal (Planet) had no hot water, but since it was hot, we didn't complain. Guayaquil was a nice ending, a city with lots to see and it seemed safer than Quito. The flight schedule Exoticca gave us was not ideal, with long layovers and double connections, but I can understand they do this to keep prices down. The breakfasts included at the hotels ranged from poor (Planet) to decent (Oro Verde in Guayaquil). Overall, I can't recommend Exxotica tours. This was my first pre ""organized"" tour. I think I will just continue to organize trips myself. 130 countries so far! Follow-up:We heard from Exoticca and they have assured us that they have contacted the Amazon lodge in question and hopefully, for any lodgers, this will prevent you from having a roach filled room. I would like to thank Exoticca for actually contacting me after this review, hearing me out, and giving me come compensation for the hotel nightmare."
2025-06-17,N/A,"Great guides and partners, terrible planning and service.","Exoticca partner with some great local guides who perform an amazing service and are very friendly and knowledgeable. However, Exoticca exclusively handles flights for your bookings. In all of my bookings with them, three so far, the flights have had issues.On every trip, my flights to the destination or back to my home country have been cancelled and because of that i have had to reroute through multiple layovers, which has been a headache. Often last minute which can also cause visa issues.I had to call to book one trip, due to their website not working, asked for them to book me business class tickets as it was a 14 hour flight, they said no problem. Got the tickets and they booked economy, and then refused to correct their mistake and told me if you want to change it, book new flights but you can't have a refund.Then on some group trips, they'll sporadically book you and other travellers across several flights at silly times. I had a 12 noon checkout from a hotel, and they booked me on a 10pm flight with an activity planned for 8am the next morning, when this was raised with them ""the flights are within the itinerary dates"" was the only answer I could get, without any sense of logic or thought into how that reflects on the actual trip. When I asked them to change my flights to match everyone else's, more reasonable 3pm flights, they said nope, you can book them yourself and you can't get a refund.I'd recommend Exoticca, simply so you can find some great local guides and go from there, but do not let them book flights for you, frankly the 10 minutes extra you spend booking your own flights will save you immeasurable amounts of stress. Their customer service will be of no use, and you can deal with the flights directly."
2025-06-16,N/A,Birthday Trip Was Ruined by Exoticca and Their Local Partner,"My friends and I booked Exoticca’s Portugal & Spain escorted tour as a special birthday trip, expecting a guided cultural experience as advertised. What we received was a disorganized, unsupported experience — largely due to the failures of Exoticca’s local partner, Look4Portugal (L4P).From the outset, no tour guide was ever assigned to our group. This was sold as an escorted tour, yet we were left solely with a driver — who was kind, professional, and did his best, but not trained or informed to act as a tour guide. There was no commentary, no structured itinerary, and no on-the-ground support. We were simply dropped off at sites with no context or explanation.After we raised concerns, Look4Portugal misled Exoticca by claiming a guide had been provided — referring to our driver. This was a clear misrepresentation. A driver is not a substitute for a licensed guide. We later learned that L4P had intentionally chosen not to assign a guide due to our group being small — a decision that was never disclosed to us and completely undermined the product we paid for. Even worse, they fired the driver, who was not at fault and did his best under the circumstances. This felt incredibly unfair and deflective of real accountability.We also tried to contact Look4Portugal multiple times using the WhatsApp and phone number provided in our welcome documents — no one ever responded. We had zero local support, no daily communication, and no way to confirm what was happening with the itinerary or excursions.One of the biggest disappointments was being denied entry to the Alhambra in Granada — a major tour highlight — because neither company secured our tickets in advance. We had paid for the tour over 90 days prior, yet when we arrived at the Alhambra, we found out we didn't have tickets and they were already sold out. So instead, we were walked around the exterior gardens and missed the full experience completely.Each day began with stress and confusion, as we had no idea what the schedule was or what to expect. Optional excursions were never offered, and we missed out on experiences we would have gladly booked had they been presented.In summary:Look4Portugal failed to deliver the guided experience promised.They misled Exoticca during the follow-up investigation.They offered no local communication or support.And they fired the only person who showed up — our driver — who was not at fault.If you're considering a tour with Exoticca, and Look4Portugal is listed as the local operator, please reconsider. This provider takes no accountability, misrepresents facts, and left us with a trip that did not match what we paid for or were promised.While Exoticca didn’t cause these failures directly, they are responsible for the vendors they contract and how they handle complaints. In this case, their resolution fell short of addressing the seriousness of the situation.We cannot recommend Exoticca based on this experience. If you’re considering one of their tours, get detailed confirmation of what will be delivered — and be prepared to push for accountability if things go wrong."
2025-06-16,N/A,Expensive. Poor communicators.,"Poor service and communication from customer care team in UK and Turkey. Balloon trip cancelled. It wasn't clear if balloon could be rescheduled. I said I wanted a refund as I was advised when booking you will be refunded if trip cancelled. Despite me chasing with all parties at the time, I wasn't advised I wouldn't get a refund. Exoticca overcharged me for the holiday and balloon trip. Other holidaymakers paid considerably less. Cheaper to book balloon trip with guide in resort, but they don't tell you that when booking. I recommend you don't trust this company. They are not honest."
2025-06-16,N/A,Do NOT recommend,"I would not recommend booking with Exoticca or any tours operated through them. Our experience was deeply disappointing and completely unprofessional from start to finish.There was no guide present for the entirety of our trip—a basic and essential component of any guided tour. Because of this, we missed all optional excursions, including highly anticipated visits to Sintra and Pena Palace, the Toledo tour, and dinner shows. The driver provided no information or itinerary details, making it impossible to plan anything independently, especially with last-minute schedule changes.To make matters worse, all attempts to contact the supporting agency during the trip were ignored, leaving us completely unsupported.We gave the company a chance to make it right, but they refused to compensate us fairly.This was a trip we had been looking forward to, and it fell drastically short. Save yourself the money, stress, and disappointment—look elsewhere for your travel plans."
2025-06-15,N/A,What a Shame!,"When on return from Namibia, Excoticca ask for my feedback on how I'd enjoyed my trip, l responded that l had enjoyed Namibia as it ticked a long standing desire to visit this wonderful country, but l was not at all happy with my experience with Excoticca as a travel company. They have obviously chosen to misconstrue my comments, ignore my complaints and have ask me to leave a complimentary post.I have used Excoticca on numerous occasions over the past 6 years, having nothing but praise for their customer service and professional and proactive approach, however the experience of my last 2 trips has tarnished, for me, their reputation.Where once they were quick to respond to questions and requests, this is no longer the case. A question about ground arrangements took them over 2 months to resolve, in which time l had to keep asking for an answer and in one instance, make my own arrangements.  They were certainly not proactive: constantly blaming their local agents or failing to reply to me after promising to do so.Whilst on the trip and despite hotel accommodation being named and confirmed long before departure, twice hotels were changed and at very short notice: once resulting in an approximate 5 hour arduous detour and subsequent late arrivals at next destinations, another in the use of a decidedly lower standard hotel despite its star rating. Each time the excuse given was that the original CONFIRMED hotels were fully booked!Something has happened to Excoticca.Where in the past l would have no hesitation in singing their praises to new   fellow travelers whilst on trips or recommending them in feedback on my return, l find my recent unhappy experience with them stops me from continuing to do so.What a shame!"
2025-06-12,N/A,Terrible for group travel,"Terrible for group travel. We had a really bad experience with Exxotica.Macha Pichu, the highlight of the trip, 1 person was put in a separate train coach than other 4 in the team. Even the group of 4 did not get to sit together.The tickets were only given to us the day before and any change requests must be made +48 hours before.We had paid £100 extra to have “360 view”. It turns out, all their trains have glass on the ceiling. Some are older trains at 70 Sol and some are newer at 90 sol. We were on the older ones!Then, they organised our return time in the dark. So what was the point of extra £100 if return is in the dark. This was not for a good reason (for example for us to see sunset or have longer time there).We finally arrive, then we find out we had the shortest route ticket (circuit 3 for 2.5 hours only) instead of 1 or 2 (which is average) at least for longer time. Shortest amount of time. So we didn’t get to go even to the middle. We had to leave before sunset.Inconsiderate travel planning. They planned our British groups travel through USA and so everyone had to apply  and pay for ESTA. We thought this was standard, then we find out others had traveled through Europe. They did not consider travelers at all.Paid for hotel upgrade, they put us into a chain hotel, had the same exact breakfast for the whole 10 days. No variety the whole trip and some were actually really bad hotel Choices.For Mâcha Pichu we will middle of nowhere, instead of in the city where trains leave.For our additional lake tikikaka which again we paid extra, hotel in Puno was not In the city, unsafe area with nowhere to Go, had to get taxi, tons of stray dogs barking all night. In the “Premium” hotel, they had put us on the none lake side, where there was rebel and stray dogs and we had to pay extra again to get lake view.In Cusco I got locked in the standing shower at midnight. I couldn’t get out and was freezing. Somehow managed to call reception and they took 20 min to understand that they shouldn’t wait at the door for me to let them in the room as I am stuck!!!The sacred valley tour which again was something we had paid for additionally, the tour guide just decided to skip one of the 4 locations we were suppose to visit.Exxotica is the organiser, and they commission  Condor Travel, so from the second you arrive To Peru, they are no longer involved. Exxotica’s responsibility is to provide Condor travel with correct timely information, which they had not and this effected our trip massively.Also, they are to involve the customer of the options and choices. We were not give options for “circuits” or “route”. They clearly took the cheapest option.All In all, would not recommend Exxotica for travel , save your money and go for another company.The second the agent gets your money, they don’t take your calls anymore and send you to customer service. I was told I would get extra £100 for credit and didnt and aftwr couldn’t reach or prove it."
2025-06-11,N/A,Today is my first day of my trip in…,Today is my first day of my trip in Costa Rica and driver left with out telling us I don’t know what to say and nobody answering unfortunately I cancel my trip at first day of my trip horrible customer service 🤮
2025-06-09,N/A,Very poor customer service and the promises included in your tour or not delivered.,"I just returned from a 13 night trip to Peru with Exoticca Travel.and the main concerns I had were:1. I booked business class seats with them, specifically asking them on two separate phone call conversations and they confirmed that the business class seats would be lie flat seats. When I got the confirmation 2 months later I realized we were flying on Boeing 737 and these planes do not have lie flat seats in business class. So, the promise I had received was inaccurate. After several phone calls, they did listen to the recorded conversations and confirmed that they indeed had made an error and had misinformed me about what I would be purchasing. These business class seats cost me well over $3000 per seat more than economy, and the only reason I booked them was because it was a long flight and we wanted the lie flat option. They have offered me $150 in compensation for this error. Totally inadequate and unfair in my mind.2. When you phone Exoticca Travel, you can only talk to the front line customer service rep, never to a tier 2 or manager, who has power to make changes. They always respond with an email, never a conversation. Another major frustration.3. Another significant issue we had on our trip was that Exoticca Travel does not provide you with a consistent tour guide for your entire tour, nor are the participants consistent throughout as well. Our tour group was totally fluid and constantly changing something I had not expected nor did I appreciate it.4. My final issue, not as significant, but we had booked an excursion to go to the natural Hot Springs in the Colca Canyon. No shuttle was there to pick us up, no instructions were given as to how we could get there and we never were able to go on this excursion. Again a frustrating scenario. This was a site we had wanted to go to, and we were unable.In conclusion, I would never use Exoticca Travel again nor would I ever recommend it to any of my family or friends."
2025-06-09,N/A,"Terrible service, not worth 1 star","Still trying to resolve booking problem since March. Exoticca does not follow thru on promises, both verbal and written. Approx 40 emails and calls.  Held for 30 min again today and gave up, calling only runs up my phone bill.Emails and forms get canned response and no action. ""sorry,have patience, we are working on it"" for months now.  This is a simple booking change with flights that were promised by Exoticca open and seats available.Enough of trying to blame the carrier, this is on Exoticca for failing to act and making false promises.  They won't fix or refund and no way to escalate.   A better reply to amend this terrible service would be 'Sorry we couldn't resolve, here is your money back"". Fix it or give us money back, no more ""sorry, we are working on it, have patience""."
2025-06-09,N/A,Have tried 4 times now to get detail…,"Have tried 4 times now to get detail information about a trip to Africa. Call centre staff just don't have the knowledge or insight about the trips. Call centre have been great in the past, but can't answer any questions. They are just sales reps. Very poor training.June 9 - Received immediate AI response. They want a Booking ID - Not booking anything until some calls me???? Probably giving up. They have my phone #."
2025-06-13,N/A,Truly dreadful company,Booking ID:UK-EX2025349595Truly dreadful company. Stranded at an airport on an Exoticca tour through absolutely no fault of our own. The 24/7 “helpline” did not respond to our desperate pleas for help. A Good Samaritan helped us in attempting to sort things. Next morning still stranded but having managed to get ourselves onto another much longer flight Exoticca had absolutely no interest whatever. Shoddy and abysmal customer service. Another of the “not our problem” brigade. Avoid if you want a holiday with even a modicum of support
2025-06-03,N/A,Do not use Exoticca,"Do not use Exoticca.  Paid a lot of money for a 13 day trip to Greece.  We had terrible accommodations, except for 1 hotel.  Very very disappointed.  Never again Exoticca."
2025-06-01,N/A,Bait-and-Switch Tactics – Beware Before Booking!,"We have traveled with Exoticca multiple times, but this most recent experience has left me extremely disappointed — and honestly, frustrated. They promised baggage was included in our booking, and then later revoked that without warning. As a result, we will have to pay an additional $400 out of pocket just for luggage. That’s not a small mistake — that’s a major cost dumped on the customer. Even with multiple communication on the matter, they just say ""sorry about it"" only.What’s worse is that this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. It’s becoming a pattern with Exoticca: offer one thing when booking, then quietly change it later. It feels like a bait-and-switch tactic.As a loyal customer who has supported their business through several trips, I expected better. This kind of behavior is unprofessional and dishonest. I’m very disappointed, and I’ll be thinking twice before booking with them again — and I recommend other travelers to be more careful."
2025-06-06,N/A,Poor customer service,"6.6.25 As update, yet another week and more calls without resolution (since March).  As 2 senior ladies travelling to a country where English is not the language, we do not want to experience  problems at destination.  If this is the ""service"" we get PRIOR to the trip...what would happen if there is an issue at destination?  I do not want to be stranded at 4 am in a foreign country while Exoticca tells me (if I can get through) to have patience, they are working on it, etc.   Exoticca is, however, very good to remind me to give them final payment and takes quick action if you want to add on a tour.  Don't make much of the ""100% response to poor reviews"" on Trustpilot,  all they did is say they are working on it, have patience, yada yada, same thing I have heard for months. ""response"" is not same as resolution. If you can't fix the problem, give us our money back.Poor customer service. Over 30 calls/emails over 2 months and problem is getting worse.Auto reply says will get answer within 5 days then nothing so call/email again, repeat, repeat. Offered flight change then didn't book, but did book worse flt.  Long hold times, different answer each time. Tries to blame carrier but plenty of seats open on flight offered."
2025-05-28,N/A,Airline booking by Exoticca (Careful to check the prices their team quotes),"My experience with Exoticca customer service team has been very negative so far. I booked the Portugal Costal tour and the travel expert failed to mention that they would be booking the most basic fare ticket (the lowest fare which allows no change/no upgrades/ no seat selection/ no checked-in baggage). When I asked them to add checked baggage, they said that it was not their responsibility to let the customer know that the basic ticket was being booked. After a lot of back and forth with the customer service team and legal complaint, they finally upgraded the ticket to a standard ticket. When I asked them to upgrade the ticket to business class they quoted me 3 times the price, quoted by the airline (the upgrade was for done by the airline for $2000 when Exoticca quoted me $6000). When I followed up multiple times, their customer service team just stopped responding to emails. I would recommend going with any other travel provider as they do have massive margins built into their prices and they provide no services once the booking is made."
2025-05-27,N/A,The prices and dates kept changing on…,"The prices and dates kept changing on the same package, and when I tried to call, I got an error message that the number was unavailable.Then I messaged and was offered a call back, but the call never came."
2025-05-26,N/A,returned from S African safari,"returned from S African safari.   poor communication on pickup transfers, no signage from transfer person when arriving at airport or hotel to pick 5 of us up.  changes in flights & asked for assistance.  response came 6 hours later after we ran to catch flights with 30min grace.  the 24 hours service doesn't really seem very effective  always a standard message will get back to you type of message.  others in group said ""lack of communication"",  had hop on hop off bus tour with trip to table mountain.  we had to navigate through google & realized that is how we get to that excursion.  Could have told us that & said that is what hop on hop off is used for that same day.  hotel in downtown Cape Town was low budget & in a very unsafe area of town & would rate at 2 star & would not go back there if that is where hotel was again.  Cape Diamond Hotel,  very dated & turned off our hydro on us on last night at we think midnight bc we were leaving next day   our clothes were all damp from humidity.  My friends medication was all melted.  I could actually go on. The actual safari etc was excellent,  hotel near Kruger was appropriate  Exoticca can do better!!  I would not recommend Exoticca after this experience."
2025-05-26,N/A,Awful tour company but lovely country,"We had a 9 night stay in Peru booked through Exoticca which was then run locally by Condor Travel. Peru was lovely and some of the individual guides we had were brilliant but the organisation and overall experience of the tour were awful from the start.A brief overview- inconsistent communication leading to massively stressful errors you have to resolve independently- bizarre organisation of group transfers with little thought into how early some transfers are which result in feeling like everyone has a different experience of the tour- new guides and drivers every day/activityDay 1:We arrived and were given a two page itinery with pick up times. Our guide told us we could ask her any questions about the trip and then gave us individual times for a transfer to our tour the next day (which was not on the itinery). We asked about when we would receive tickets for internal flights and she told us we needed to check in for that ourselves. This was incorrect information and us trying to check in resulted in a problem with the tickets and Condor travel could not check us in.Day 2: We got up early due to the time the guide had told us the day before only to learn this was an orientation meeting and we had the opportunity to get breakfast between that and out tour. During the orientation the guide tried to upsell several other excursions through condor travel. Our tour for this day was adapted due to a strike in Lima (unavoidable but not communicated before) which meant we missed out on seeing Lima’s historical landmarks.Day 3: 2.30 am transfer to the airport for Cusco where we had to resolve our own ticket issues at the airport. We were provided no reassurance by Condor travel that this would be sorted and were informed that the guide would help us once all other travellers were checked in. The rest of the day went smoothly but the whole group was put on different transfers. The hotel additionally was mis advertised as having a pool.Day 4: Machu Picchu – mostly went okay. We had learnt the day before that the breakfast boxes provided by the hotels we were booked in were awful (a small cheese sandwich on stale bread with bruised fruit and a juice box) so we had managed to buy our own lunch. Our guide Alicia was excellent and very informative, we really enjoyed the visit. The only difficult part of the day was waiting around in the town for the later train when others in our group had an early train. We didn’t get back to the hotel until 10pm with a 7am transfer the next day.Day 5: Sacred valley tour. We got our first and only breakfast at the hotel which was not very good and not what you would consider a continental breakfast. The sacred Valley tour run by Ruth was lovely she was another excellent guide, very patient with our group and we actually had an excellent buffet lunch that day. Unfortunately when we arrived in Cusco we were presented with a twin room, the hotel were apologetic but had no doubles available. Exoticca/Condor travel were not helpful and we learnt they had requested the change for this and subsequent hotels.Day 6: We spent in Cusco which was lovely. Breakfast continued to be bad but that meant we were able to enjoy the food in the city. We had to contact Condor travel/Exoticca again about our room for the next night and they seemed unaware of previous communication or that they were supposed to contact us. Instead I contacted the next hotel myself.Day 7: Touristic bus to puno – long drive though lovely scenery so well worth it. Lunch was below our expectations. Arrived to the hotel to find that our room had only been changed to a double because of our communications with the hotel.Day 8: Boat tout of Lake Tititacca – this was excellent and was the only day that nothing went wrong.Day 9: transfer back to Lima – we arrived at the airport (with only two airlines) several hours early so felt like we missed out on time in either Puno or LimaDay 10: We were supposed to have a 1.30am transfer to the airport (which was disappointing as some people got to spend a morning or even the whole day in lima), we were awoken at 12.50am by the front desk to inform us our Spanish only speaking driver was here. This turned out to be a private transfer and we were checked in, through security, and at out gate 3 hours before our flight so again felt this was unnecessarily early.Overall would strongly discourage anyone from taking tours with Exoticca or Condor travel whilst also adding that Peru is a lovely country to visit with friendly people and excellent cuisine."
2025-05-26,N/A,Only one day where something didn't go wrong...,"We had a 9 night stay in Peru booked through Exoticca which was then run locally by Condor Travel. Peru was lovely and some of the individual guides we had were brilliant but the organisation and overall experience of the tour were awful from the start.A brief overview- inconsistent communication leading to massively stressful errors you have to resolve independently- bizarre organisation of group transfers with little thought into how early some transfers are which result in feeling like everyone has a different experience of the tour- new guides and drivers every day/activityDay 1:We arrived and were given a two page itinery with pick up times. Our guide told us we could ask her any questions about the trip and then gave us individual times for a transfer to our tour the next day (which was not on the itinery). We asked about when we would receive tickets for internal flights and she told us we needed to check in for that ourselves. This was incorrect information and us trying to check in resulted in a problem with the tickets and Condor travel could not check us in.Day 2: We got up early due to the time the guide had told us the day before only to learn this was an orientation meeting and we had the opportunity to get breakfast between that and out tour. During the orientation the guide tried to upsell several other excursions through condor travel. Our tour for this day was adapted due to a strike in Lima (unavoidable but not communicated before) which meant we missed out on seeing Lima’s historical landmarks.Day 3: 2.30 am transfer to the airport for Cusco where we had to resolve our own ticket issues at the airport. We were provided no reassurance by Condor travel that this would be sorted and were informed that the guide would help us once all other travellers were checked in. The rest of the day went smoothly but the whole group was put on different transfers. The hotel additionally was mis advertised as having a pool.Day 4: Machu Picchu – mostly went okay. We had learnt the day before that the breakfast boxes provided by the hotels we were booked in were awful (a small cheese sandwich on stale bread with bruised fruit and a juice box) so we had managed to buy our own lunch. Our guide Alicia was excellent and very informative, we really enjoyed the visit. The only difficult part of the day was waiting around in the town for the later train when others in our group had an early train. We didn’t get back to the hotel until 10pm with a 7am transfer the next day.Day 5: Sacred valley tour. We got our first and only breakfast at the hotel which was not very good and not what you would consider a continental breakfast. The sacred Valley tour run by Ruth was lovely  she was another excellent guide, very patient with our group and we actually had an excellent buffet lunch that day.

2025-05-22,N/A,"Does anybody work for this company, impossible to get a reply about anything",It is impossible to get any reply from this company. Once you have paid for your trip they are not interested in you. Concerned that they might be going into liquidation as they certainly do not have sufficient staff
2025-05-21,N/A,Unethical practices,"This is a partial review but so far my experience does not bode well. I’m due to travel on an Exoticca trip in Nov 2025 and I’ve never used them before but my friend has and she suggested if she books us the trip, we can use her credit. I agreed. We booked. Now a couple of months later, I suggested a flight upgrade to business with BA as it’s a trip for my birthday. She called up several times and was told different things. In the end, I was able to check online using ‘Manage my booking’ directly with BA using Exoticca’s IATA code and got the upgrade price. When my friend called Exoticca again today, they’ve quoted for the exact same upgrade to Business, nearly £900 more each per person than BA. The total upgrade price is almost the same as buying a new business class seat directly from BA. Utterly outrageous and unethical. I’m not looking forward to the trip if this is how it’s already started.***Update following Exoticca’s response***I’ve now provided my booking ID via Instagram as trying to contact them via phone or email is hard work. I’m aware travel agents versus individuals may receive different prices, but you cannot justify or defend an economy to business class upgrade at nearly £900 per person MORE than BA’s own website quote to upgrade today. There’s no justification for such a disparity.Pps - no email has been received by myself or my friend who booked the trip. We have checked spam / junk and nothing has come through from you. I suggest you double check the email addresses you are using or perhaps use the telephone and call. This is what I was referring to earlier in my review, when I said communication with Exoticca is hard work."
2025-05-19,N/A,The fees for our trip were paid more…,"The fees for our trip were paid more than 2 weeks ago. Since then we’ve received numerous emails. I also downloaded the Exoticca App.None of the emails contain our itinerary including flights. Every email tells me the departure date is near and I to download that magical app of yours. A couple of days ago an email came promising to have all data in one document. Foiled and frustrated again. I saw buttons for flights, hotels etc. When I clicked on them nothing happened. Oh, I was asked to download the app again. Please send me the data in one document ment that I can access easily. Harry Muntanion."
2025-05-12,N/A,Customer service after initial booking,"We booked our trip with another family in Dec 2024 on a linked booking for a trip to South Africa. We are regular Exotticca customers and have generally had great experiences on previous trips. In January 2025 we noticed that our flights had been changed from what was originally booked so both families called to ask to be put back on the original booked flights.  We were told that an inquiry was started to review the call when we made the booking. We received no feedback  even after following up multiple times via telephone and email with the last inquiry being March 2025. 3 1/2 weeks ago the other family noticed their flights were adjusted to the original booked flights and our family’s flights were not changed, even though the bookings are linked on file.  I have called and talked to an agent 4 times and also emailed my inquiry 5 times.  Each week I follow up by phone call with a long hold time (35 min to 1 hour) to speak to yet again, another agent who tells me that they will open up a case and get back to me in 2-5 days, that because my travel is not until October, that it is not a priority and that they will look into it. I have 5 cases open and no follow up to date.  The agents are all very nice and I would like to see the company have clear follow up to requests in a a timely manner - I was told it goes to the flight department, however there is no evidence of this in the past 3 1/2 weeks. This entire request has been in process from January 2025 and it is May 12 2025 today.  This seems to be a common complaint for this company for many years and it appears they have not taken the time to change the way they serve their customers after they have made the initial deposit.  I am disappointed in the time taken to resolve this issue and still it is not resolved.  I am also disappointed in the communication process - customer seems to have to work harder than the company to keep the communication going."
2025-05-12,N/A,This is the second time I have booked…,This is the second time I have booked Exoticca. The trips are great but you can never reach their customer service or billing for any questions. Have been on hold for over 2 hours today to question the final payment for our next trip. Only people you can reach is those who want to book. Terrible customer service!
2025-05-08,N/A,I booked a 12 days trip in April to…,"I booked a 12 days trip in April to Peru (in August) but realized that the flight to Lima from Vancouver has 2 stops instead of 1. I told the booking agent the specific flight details but he made the mistake. I called exoticca about once a week to follow up with the investigation and hopefully I can switch it back to 1 stop. I was told that my conversation with the booking agent was taped and therefore the team will check it. I will not be charged for the change of flight if the agent made that mistake. However, it's been over a month and I still haven't heard from Exoticca. You will have a follow up reply in 3 days is a lie. I am so disappointed because I did have high hope with this company!"
2025-05-06,N/A,We booked for 11 days Buenos Aires,"We booked for 11 days Buenos Aires, Iguazu Falls and BRAZIL.  We checked when we book if visa's were needed.  They were NOT.  Apparently laws changed and April 10th if you were from USA, CANDA or AUSTRALIA you needed a visa to enter Brazil.  We never received notification that the laws had changed and only learned the day before we were to enter Brazil.  So, we were not able to.  I contacted Exoticca about the issue and was informed they would do nothing to help us make any changes in order to get home since our return home flights were out of BRAZIL.  That we needed to make all arrangements ourselves, and pay for it ourselves.  They would not refund us for un-used hotel nights, or flights to Brazil and then flights home from Brazil to the USA.  7 of us had planned to go to Spain next year with Exoticca next year, but I would never book with them again after this experience.  You are left on your own in a country where almost no one speaks English and Exoticca offers no help. Like someone else said, they take your money and you are left on your own!"
2025-05-06,N/A,I asked for help in paying for a trip…,"I asked for help in paying for a trip when the invoice was not as expected and got some ""standardized"" response instead of help from someone that can solve the problem. You would think when they are holding thousands of my dollars you would get some help."
2025-05-05,N/A,"Turkey, Treasures of Anatolia","Firstly, I would like to mention that our guide Lider and our driver Kadir were excellent adjusting to the bicycle tour road closures, re-routing our destinations,   finding an alternative balloon ride, etc.It is the company Exoticca that I’m disappointed with.We were only given an hour between flights from Frankfurt to Istanbul. This was very stressful as we had to navigate through an unknown terminal to another terminal. Thankfully, we backpacked, so we didn’t have to go through baggage.Next was the Cappadocia balloon ride. We booked our trip in November 2024. The date in our itinerary was Day 6.  Then on the evening of Day 5, we were informed we were rescheduled to Day 7. That’s all Exoticca told our guide. NO EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN when we contacted Exoticca either. Day 7 was a no go due to inclement weather.Our guide, Lider, was able to book a balloon ride in Pamukkale. IT WAS NOT A SUNRISE balloon ride. NOR WAS THE SCENERY AND LANDSCAPE AS IMPRESSIVE as that of Cappadocia. It was also less expensive than the original price we paid. We are requesting the difference be credited to our credit cards not the Exoticca wallet.Hotels: We did not like the Radisson Blu in Ankara. It was very old and it showed in terms of the cleanliness, lack of hot water in the suite, and overall quality.The Merida Hotel was clean. However, neither the door to our suite nor the bathroom door closed easily or properly. It only closed with pressure and always slammed shut.The water in the bathroom sink sputtered out of the sink tap for several minutes before any type of flow ensued.The shower knob kept releasing, so an actual shower consisted of continually playing with the shower knob.Also, the noise level inside the hotel was deafening due to children screaming and running in the halls until after 11 pm.The meals were okay. Unsupervised children were touching all types of food and putting them back into the containers. This affected our food choices as we only took food items the children appeared Not to have touched.I realize the last two complaints are due to lack of parental supervision and training. However, staff in the dining room did Not say anything to the children or their parents.This was our fourth trip through Exoticca. We were very disappointed as it did not live up to the quality of the previous three trips."
2025-05-02,N/A,Radio silence after paying,Very hard to make contact with them or get a reply once you have paid for your trip. I am actually concerned that they might be having financial troubles as they do not seem to have any staff. I am using this to see if they will contact me via Trustpilot as all other methods seem to fail
2025-05-02,N/A,Long wait times to speak with a…,"Long wait times to speak with a customer service agent and terrible communication when a request is submitted.  Because I booked my air and travel with Exoticca, I thought it would make my life easier but trying to pay for checked luggage is almost $300 per passenger and also a charge for airplane seating.  Now I am contacting the airline directly so I'm doing Exoticca's job and won't get ripped off. First and last time I'm traveling with Exoticca.  The airline has taken care of my reservation but seating was limited due it is so late. I'm going to Costa Rica, Amy CA-EX2024288036"
2025-04-30,N/A,Company cheaps out and cuts corners to…,"Company cheaps out and cuts corners to save on costs and make more money at your expenseMy retired parents are on a trip with them and they booked them the cheapest flights possible with multiple multi-hour layovers when direct flights exist. You know those cheap flight tickets that nobody wants to book unless you are really working with an extremely limited budget because you have to wait in airports 4-5-6-7 hours between your flights and leave/arrive at midnight or other odd hours.Once they finally got to their destination after a 16 hours travel day that could've been 8  hours, they were supposed to stay in a hotel to fly out again the next day. Well Exoticca booked them a hotel 45 minutes away from the airport which means 45 minutes to the hotel, sleep a few hours, 45 minutes back to the airport. I looked it up and there were hotels available right by the airport for ~20$ more. Really? I would've understood if it was a 150$/night difference but 20$? When the customer is paying 6-7000$ for their trip?This has left a bad taste in our mouths as a family. When you're paying 6-7000$ for a trip it's not a budget trip where you're counting every penny. This to me is unacceptable greed at the expense of the customer experience. My parents travel 3-4 times a year and will probably reconsider their relationship with Exoticca."
2025-05-02,N/A,Turkey in 11 days…- disappointed,"An update- Following Exoticca's prompt response to my negative review, I’ve been informed that my feedback has been forwarded to the relevant team. They will be thoroughly reviewing the itinerary to ensure necessary improvements are made.I recently joined the Turkey in 11 days group tour with high expectations of exploring Turkey’s rich history and breathtaking landscapes. Unfortunately, what should have been a cultural and historical journey turned into a **shopping-driven expedition**, detracting from the actual sightseeing experience.#### **Excessive Shopping Stops & Hard Selling**Instead of focusing on iconic landmarks, the itinerary **steered us into multiple shopping locations** where aggressive sales techniques were used. If I had wanted a shopping tour, I would have booked one explicitly. Some of the worst experiences included:- **Textile Shop Before Pamukkale:** A **60-minutes delay** meant we had only **1.5 hours** at Pamukkale, barely enough time to see the amphitheater and travertines, with no opportunity to explore the necropolis.- **Misleading Leather Shop Visit:** The itinerary mentioned a visit to an **artisan leather shop** to observe craftsmanship, yet we were taken to a **retail store with a fashion show**, wasting **2 hours** that should have been spent in Ephesus.- **Overpriced Shopping Recommendations:** The guide frequently **urged purchases**, only for us to later realise that many items were **100% or more expensive** than their actual value.#### **Limited Time at Cultural Landmarks**The few sightseeing opportunities we had felt **rushed and incomplete**:- **Bursa:** Only **30 minutes** allowed in the town center, far too little to experience the city properly.- **Ephesus:** Insufficient time due to prior shopping stops, preventing us from fully exploring this incredible archaeological site.#### **Forced Dining with Inflated Prices**Lunches were arranged in **remote areas** with no alternatives, forcing the group into **set menus at $15 per person**—an overpriced option with no flexibility. When other people requested to dine in Bursa’s city center, the guide **refused**, taking us instead to another isolated restaurant. Many of us **declined to eat there**, frustrated by the lack of choice.#### **Unfair Currency Exchange & Missing Payment**Beyond the shopping pressure, the guide also **added a commission** when handling payment for tips and tourist tax setting the rate at **39.5 Turkish lira per dollar instead of 38**. Additionally, when I handed over **4000 Turkish lira** (2x $50) he claimed to owe me **50 lira** but never returned it—despite being Turkish himself, making the excuse highly questionable. While the amount was small, the **lack of honesty and professionalism** was unacceptable.### **Final Thoughts: A Tour That Felt Like a Sales Trap**This trip **failed to deliver** the cultural depth I expected. The excessive time spent in **overpriced shopping locations**, forced meals, misleading recommendations, and unethical handling of payments **turned an anticipated adventure into a frustrating experience**.If you are looking for **genuine exploration**, this tour is **not for you**. The itinerary **needs a complete overhaul** to focus on history, nature, and authentic local experiences—**not a commercial shopping circuit disguised as a cultural tour**.Booking ref: UK-EX2025341434"
2025-04-25,N/A,My flight had to turn back and were…,My flight had to turn back and were delayed 6 hours I called Exoticca has I was stuck on the plane to contact my transfer for pick up I am now waiting to get my flight so sent a message to my airport pick with the new time and was told that I had NO PICK UP HAVE TO PAY FOR IT MY SELF  I was told all transfers were in my booking so not happy
2025-04-25,N/A,No customer service at all…use another service please.,"This company could start by having customer service. Completely non existing. We're a travel industry family since 1986 and never have I had such a desire to leave a review. 3 of us in our group spent countless hours on hold. Disconnected. Transfered to the wrong extension. If it were a real time emergency we'd be in trouble. How do I know? Twice I was transferred to the emergency extension and waited 45 minutes for the transfer after waiting an hour for the original pickup. I also had to laugh after waiting 57 minutes (yes, I kept track) for an online chat rep to come on the chat when they told me if I needed faster service I could send an email or use the online chat!  We should have stuck with our old reliable Gate one service. They actually communicate."
2025-04-24,N/A,Too bad I have to give them 1 star…,"Too bad I have to give them 1 star since they deserve 0 starsI just finished my tour in Turkey and here’s a brief summary of our experiences:Day 1: pick up drivers excellent the contact person that they assigned me Mostafa was supposed to meet as soon as I was settled in our hotel but he didn’t; I met him by luck in the lobby around 9:30pm when we arrived around 2-3pm, any way he was not helpful at all.  Elite world hotel is a 4-5 stars maybe and Exoticca failed to informed us that Air conditioning is not available during “winter time”. Room temperature was between 76-80 degrees, their offered option was to open the windows to get fresh air; we paid for luxury to superior hotels.The only good service that we received was the tour guide and driver, they were professional and very helpful.Hotel in Ankara Radisson Blu the worst, stained ceilings and broken/moldy shower tiles; the food we couldn’t figured out if it was over cooked or from cans, some people from my group we went to Burger King.  Before I forget we booked 2 rooms, 1 single and 1 double; well I have trouble on every hotel because I keep getting 2 rooms with a single bed (I was not planning on sleeping with my mother in the same bed.  Just so you know the size of the beds from double suites are twin not that comfortable.The majority of travelers from my group were not satisfied with Exoticca services and choice of hotels.My suggestion is not to spend extra money on superior / luxury hotels because you will get the same hotels as their regular 4-5 stars hotels.Will I book a travel with Exoticca in the future?  Definitely no"
2025-04-19,N/A,Exoticca promises and then refuses to deliver,"The biggest issue we had, by far, was being PROMISED a free tour of our choice (up to $367 PP) by Austin in sales and then being told they didn't know anything about this.  I asked them to review the recording of our booking. They did.  After agreeing that the audio CONFIRMED a the free tour for ALL 3 OF US, they refused to deliver.  When we got to Turkey, we found they only gave ONE free tour to ME.  They THEN claimed it was because the other 2 people had to start a claim of their own....RIDICULOUS. THIS WAS NEVER STATED IN ANY PREVIOUS EMAILS. I WAS THE ONE WHO BOOKED ALL OF US AND WHO NEGOTIATED FOR 3 OF US….To make matters worse, when we were told they had to each apply, we did that IMMEDIATELY and was told they were too late!!!   If you were asked to do something to fulfill this request and then immediately told you were too late, you would know the intent was to justify and to deceive.  One person had to pay an unexpected $340 IN CASH for her tour and the other $110.  We believe they are entitled to a refund of their PROMISED TOURS!!!Guide promoted his 25 years with the government as a tour guide (he was not with the tour company chosen by Exoticca....Euroriente).  I believe most of his previous clients were NOT English speaking. He had great knowledge, but his English pronunciation and grammar were below par.  He was hard working and spiritual, which were positives, but we were constantly asking others what he was saying and most just shrugged.Also, we were told IN WRITING that if you took the morning included tour in IST, that transportation was included back to the hotel if you didn’t stay for optional tour afterwards. He told us that THIS IS NOT TRUE AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING EXOTICCA FOR 5 YEARS TO CORRECT THE WORDING FOR THIS AND OTHER MISTAKES HE HAD TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO CLIENTS, making him the bearer of bad news and costing clients more money and inconvenience that was not expected.We had been on an EGYPT tour with Exoticca and really enjoyed it with no complaints.  This was subpar and it was disappointing to learn Exoticca allows agents to make promises they have no intention of keeping.  They already have their booking numbers through NUMEROUS EMAILS.  The time wasted on the trip contacting and re-contacting Exoticca was also exhausting and took away from the very little free time we had.I sent in my review (similar to this one) and for over a week, this is the only reply we got!!!  No one should have to jump through all the hoops Exoticca sets up just so they can keep from delivering on a promise!!""Thank you for your feedbackSorry to hear your experience with us didn’t meet your expectations.We will dutifully review your comments so we can improve our services and provide a better experience in the future.Please do not hesitate to contact us should you wish to discuss your feedback further.""Keeping your word matters!"
2025-04-18,N/A,Disappointed,"I booked a holiday with Exoticca last year for this year in June. Up until recently, everything seemed pretty straightforward; The team have been attentive to everything, the invitation for our China visas have been sent along with the itinerary etc. so, all good.A couple of weeks ago, I queried how much it would be to upgrade our flights to Premium Economy or Business class. I was given the prices and advised that I would get back to them after speaking with my partner. A week ago, I attempted to contact them by chat at 10.30 am (it states it is open from 9 am-5 pm), but no response, so I tried again the following day and still no response. When I finally managed to speak to them (Alicia), I was told she would send an email. I waited for the email, but it never came, so I had to contact them again to be informed that there were now no seats available in Premium Economy and that it's my fault for not getting back to them in time! When I pointed out that I was waiting for an email from Alicia, I was simply ignored. I am extremely disappointed because the trip is booked for my partner's 50th birthday.Despite the fact I am disappointed, I probably wouldn't have left this review if the following also hadn't happened:When I booked the flights, I wasn't aware that I could travel to China without a Visa, using my Cypriot passport, so I booked using my UK passport. When I was advised by the Visa application centre that I didn't need a Visa, I contacted Exoticca to request that my passport be amended for my flights. I was informed (by Alicia again) that they could change my flight, but that the invitation letter could not be amended. I responded that surely this is irrelevant, I wouldn't need the invitation letter anyway? This morning, however, I received a new invitation letter containing my Cypriot passport details! Alicia clearly doesn't know what she's doing.Everything that has happened so far, along with the recent bad reviews on Trustpilot, has left me extremely anxious that what is meant to be an exciting birthday trip is not going to be that great for my partner, particularly as he is is 6'4"" and is now not going to have much legroom on a 9 hour flight. Yes, I probably should have booked the Premium Economy to start with but unfortunately, my funds couldn't stretch that far at the time of booking this expensive birthday present.I really just hope that the trip goes as planned and that there are no more hiccups."
2025-04-19,N/A,Customer Service Assistance for Seat Change due to Medical Condition,"My husband and I leave for Ireland on 4.22.25.  I injured my hip and require total hip replacement upon return.  I called a month prior to departure to request and upgrade for our seats due to my medical condition and difficulty walking/sitting.  Still had recieved no response  to my request 5 days prior to flight.  Delta advised me in the beginning, they had seats and only Exocitta could change the seats.  Now 5 days prior to departure, I had to call them and ask the status.  By this time, I'm sure seats are much higher..........no help at all.  They say I will be contacted today, but I've heard that before.  Terrible customer service.Just received an answer from Exocitta and it was a total and complete lie....they stated that Delta would not allow a change - I personally spoke to Delta and the representative stated NOT TRUE - Exocitta can change your seat, you must insist they do so.  Very unprofessional and they have no problem putting a lie in writing.My husband and I are Seniors and I have a medical condition.  Have been completely shut down by your customer service department.There is no where to reply to your request  for my booking number.  It is US-EX2024267347........last name is Rose.......Provided the infomration and just like all the other times I have requested assistance......NO RESPONSE.You can reference/hide behind the wrriten language, however when you actually call the airlines, they will tell you exactly what they have told me, you as the tour group have the ability to change my seats from ecomony to a different area, which I am willing to pay for.  Stop with the dishonesty."
2025-04-16,N/A,Aweful Customer Service,"On April 7.2025, I booked a trip to Italy (). After I had given my deposit, I received the Trip Summary, and to my shock, I realized the days booked at the hotels did not match the itinerary dates. I called back the agent who made the booking, and she informed me that she no longer handles the booking and that Customer Support is the only one who can correct it. And that is when my nightmare began. Since April 7 (today is the 16th), I have been unable to talk with anyone in Customer Service. I have tried the Chat option with no success, I tried calling and holding for 1 hour on several days with no success, I filled out online forms, and no response. I feel I am out of options. This has been an awful experience. This is incredible."
2025-04-15,N/A,We booked a 13-day trip to Argentina,"We booked a 13-day trip to Argentina, Iguazu, and Brazil in April 2025. It was our first time, and we expected a tour manager or some kind of point person—but there wasn’t one. All communication was done via WhatsApp, with no live person to talk to. They would tell me to call the head office instead.The included tours were essentially the same as those available locally through platforms like GetYourGuide or Viator. Optional tours were also local offerings, but Extoccia charged nearly three times the price.In hindsight, this trip would be better (and more cost-effective) if planned independently. You could book better hotels and have much more flexibility. There’s no real tour guidance—you're basically on your own.We ran into an issue with our Visa and received little to no assistance. While Extoccia claims it’s the traveler’s responsibility, they should at least highlight critical entry requirements. We thought we met the deadline for entering on April 9, but due to re-entering the border, the actual entry date counted as April 10—when the new visa rule kicked in. It was confusing and poorly communicated. Their response was slow, and we ended up resolving it ourselves. We  ended having to pay out of pocket to get ourselves back home.Overall, we wouldn’t book with them again."
2025-04-13,N/A,Overpromised and underdelivered,"Overpromised and underdelivered. Our guide was a no-show on day one. The flight I booked with my friend put us nowhere near each other, didn't give us access to our boarding passes or the ability to upgrade or order food. Connection times were too tight - almost missed connection on return. Our bus driver on day one drove 1.5 hours in the wrong direction - a 3 hour bus ride turned into nearly 6 hours on a very tight and cramped bus. Our itinerary was switched and we no longer had a clear itinerary. The guide reached us only through Whats App and kept promising things that he did not deliver. This was a trip to Costa Rica. The country was beautiful and I recommend travelling there with a different travel company."
2025-06-01,N/A,NON- EXISTENT  Customer Service,"My wife and I traveled to Portugal in March, 2025. They erroneously charged us for excursions not booked. They have NO customer service!!! I mean literally! I have never, ever, been connected to anyone after dozens of attempts,including their 888 and local customer service # and their contact email. They’ll take your money, but other than that, you are on your own.Update: Exoticca replied to Trust Pilot  with their reply to my rating below ( did not contact me and rest assured, they never will ). It is their typical response given to their numerous other 1 STAR  reviews on this website. It is a meaningless response only for their benefit. BUYER BEWARE!!5/08/25- So need to give an update. A rep from customer service eventually did connect with me (left a voicemail and emailed). They apologized and said they would contact the local tour company in Portugal and get back to me. They did a week or two later and apologized and refunded the cost of the double booked tour back to my CC. They also gave me a travel credit of $200 for a future booking for my troubles. I told them I would update my review once the refund was confirmed so I am. I will add, other than our customer service experience, my wife and I were very satisfied with our trip booked with Exottica. If they get that straightened out, we would recommend them. JW"
2025-04-15,N/A,We've booked a trip with this agency,"**As per Exoticca's response- we have still not received a call from this company** I'd recommend other travellers choose wisely.We've booked a trip with this agency.  When we first inquired, we had agents calling us 3 times a day.  Now that our trip is coming up and we need to make a change to a part of it- it's taking days to get a return call.  Just typical anything to get your booking and then we'll never hear from you.  Can someone please get back to us!!!!The response from Exoticca is so insulting.  We keep calling almost everyday.  Your rep didn't get back to us on April 9th- we called again. We have still not heard back from a supervisor to fix the situation.  Including calling agin today April 11th advising your rep that it was essential to hear back today.  Terrible service!"
2025-04-11,N/A,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"OMG! I have never experienced a ""Customer Service"" as poor as this company offers. My advice to anyone reading this: BE AWARE and read other 1-star reviews. Here is my story:On April 7, 2025, while excited about the prospect of going to Italy, I booked a tour on your website for January 20 to 28 from Miami (US-EX2025366511 ). Then I made the mistake of calling your company to ask about the possibility of adding one extra night at the end of the tour, and that's when my nightmare began. The call was answered by someone called Natalie. She aggressively took over my original booking and created one herself(US-EX2025366702 ). I will not go over how unprofessional she was; that will be another story. What I want to go over is that she booked the flights I wanted and agreed to give me the extra night (January 28) with a return flight on January 29. She gave me a quote, and I approved, understanding that the extra night in Venice was included. I paid the 60% as requested and received an email with a Trip Summary. I immediately replied that there was a mistake because the night of the 28 of January had no hotel assigned. However, a night in a hotel that was never discussed (Marcella Royal Hotel in Rome) was listed for the night of January 18. Please note that I will not be in Rome until January 21. I proceeded to ask her to get it fixed ASAP. She brushed me off, saying that she no longer has access to the record, and sent me the following:""No mistakes were made, Mr. Carlos. We booked and confirmed everything as you requested.I already sent a request for your complaint about changing the hotel in Rome, Soon you will have an answer; we still have time, as your trip is only in January. ""Well, first of all, I did not request an extra night in Rome for a night I will not be in Rome.Second, I was not requesting a change of hotel in Rome, I was OK with the one the tour package offered. My request was for an extra night at the NH Venezia Laguna Palace in VENICE for January 28Third, my trip may be in January, but I want to make sure I am paying for what I asked for and not for what she wants to impose on me. This kind of sloppy work will eventually hurt your company.Please do what is right and correct what she did wrong.I have been unsuccessful in trying to get a hold of anyone to help me out. I already gave thousands of dollars only to feel that I have been scammed.This is not fair. Someone needs to reach out and answer my futile request for a correction. I have a copy of all the emails sent and received from Natalie in the event you require verification of my communications with Natalie.How can I possibly think about doing another booking with Exoticca after this experience?"
2025-04-09,N/A,Dreamy road trip through the Balkans,"We have booked 5 trips with exoticca, 4 of them gave us very good experiences so we keep booking with exoticca but the last one of Balkans gave us very very bad experiences: 3 actives was cancelled, no others actives instead, no entry fee refund: Tito's bunker, the Tunnel Museum, the Kolasin National Park. Our itinerary shows we have 4 stars hotel in Durmitor National Park: bouqitue apartments & rooms dora but we changed to hotel & restaurant pirlitor: the temperature was under zero outside but entire hotel no hot water no heat no extra quilt(we put our clothes/coats on top of quilt to got warm), entire hotel only reception area was warm. Only half piece Flatbread with some Stale bananas, no black coffee for breakfast. We have traveled over 50 countries and this was our worst experience."
2025-04-08,N/A,Terrible Service and horrible customer service,"Again, communications with this company are appalling.   They continue to send ""give us your input"" with nothing on the other end.   I have given my input multiple times.   The trip we booked we could not make the connection in New York either the day of the trip or the next day.   Exoticca did nothing.  In the interim the cheap airline they booked lost our luggage and it took 5 days to return it - again without any assistance from Exoticca.   So they offered $200 trip credit when we paid $8,000.   So don not recommend this company.   Once they have your money that's it."
2025-05-09,N/A,The experience was one of the worst…,"The experience was one of the worst experiences with a company in my many years. The only time you speak with a person is for sales. Once you give them your credit card you're on your own. The flights were booked by them to meet our tour. The flights we approved were not the ones they booked. That proved impossible to correct prior to the trip. On the day of departure we left our home before 4:30 am to get to the airport. Very bad weather. We drove through torrential rain with tornado watches, got to the airport early and through security. We are seasoned travelers and made every possible effort. The flight was delayed 10 times and over 10 hours. The transatlantic connection in New York left before the plane left Atlanta. We rescheduled a different flight with an extra leg and and were informed by the airline after more delays that we would not arrive in time for that flight connection in a different international terminal connected by airport train and an additional security check. Also no seats next day on any carrier. Unable to get to our tour we returned home after midnight exhausted. Exoticca offered no suggestions, booking adjustments or advice. They made no attempt to contact us to offer later flights to connect with any adjusted tour. Other airlines had numerous flights depart. They didn't advise or suggest options since we wouldn't arrive as planned.  They have not refunded our money or offered a different tour date. They ""escalate"" issues in text but then don't suggest fixes or options and disappear for days when you're stuck.  Hollow exclamations with NO HELP. They blame customers and do not treat people as they would want to be treated. NO SERVICE. They lose communications that are not convenient for them that prove they offer hollow lies, even when they are provided customer copies. They will make up facts that are not true. We are a bit less than seventy. Although pretty fit one of us had a cardiac arrest 10 years ago. We don't need special transport assistance but an olympian couldn't make the connection. Instead of a nice relaxing anniversary trip we've been harassed. This was a horrible stress and frustration. WATCH OUT FOR THEM.  They have 3 stateside locations by phone which are all call forwarded to Barcelona. You do not get a contact familiar with your arrangements. They text chat with a new person every communication. The tour might have been great if they hadn't handled it like that. Never got to find out. 4/7 Since posting they have given a fractional partial refund determined by them and we have communicated via email. They indicate more resolution will be considered. I will update if this occurs. 4/9/2025 update. Nothing from them that I am aware of. They were not found by a mediator or a judge or anybody to be correct or incorrect. Since the dawn of time the exchange of money for a quoted service would be regarded as a contract by most people in any jurisdiction. When they respond what they imply is more than the actual facts.4/11 Heard from exoticca today. An actual person. I felt she listened. We will talk after the weekend. (time zone difference). Will refresh this link regularly.4/13am thinking of my many European relatives and connections in political office. Puedo escribir a hojas de Noticias en Espana tambien. Hay mas sitos que Trust Pilot en muchos paises de Europa (Suiza, alemania, hollanda, inglaterra) Exoticca Ha sido una verguenza verdadera. (The Spanish text is for barcelona's staff.) 3/15/25 Nothing different to report yet. 3/18 A reply. Thinking. 5/4 pending???"
2025-04-06,N/A,Trip 2025 361142,"Trip 2025 361142Very upset with recent experience.  This is our third trip and arrangements were made through the 888 CS.  1.The dates of the trip were confused; we wanted to leave LAX May 5 and instead was switched to April 28, 20252.  Because of the inconvenience, your rep provided my brother and I with one one free excursion.  After examining the invoice, I noticed we were charged over $300 for it.3.  Now I learned that we need a VISA to visit Brazil. I learned of this on my own and would like Exocticca to handle this like this have on prior trips.4.  So far we have spoken with three different CS reps.  Can you forward my concerns to someone who cares???Stephen and Daniel Ramirez"
2025-04-08,N/A,"18 days, Portugal and Morocco","18 days, Portugal and Morocco, March/April 2025. Before this trip I would have never believed one could see so much but experience so little of a country. Terrible and never again.The itinerary promised lots of free time to explore on our own. Very difficult to do when hotel arrivals frequently occurred after 7PM and departure times were between 8:00 and 8:30 AM. All of our Morocco lunches were organized by the guide and as I found out, at double the price of other nearby restaurants. The deepdive tours on rug making or the tannery or local oils (topical/edible) production, etc. were barely more than sales pitches. Thank goodness we had a good group of fellow travels to commiserate with."
2025-04-06,N/A,Reply to Exoticca,"Well Exoticca did reply my previous review but didn’t offer any solutions to my issue; it is obviously that they don’t care.  So yesterday I was able to interact with other travelers from Exoticca and got the opportunity to asked them if their hotels didn’t have working air conditioning and they all told me that their hotel suite have working AC and standard size beds, there hotels are 5 stars while mine it’s supposed to be superior/ luxury category with not working AC and child size beds.  Exoticca stayed that they strive to provide good customer service, well I would like to see what type of compensation I will receive for staying in a crappie hotel with no AC and uncomfortable beds, also I’m expecting them to change my hotel once I get back to Istanbul from my circuit.  If not solution will provide me I will seek legal compensation for the distress and injury that I experienced in this hotel and once I get back to US I will report them to the BBB"
2025-04-04,N/A,Extremely disappointed,"As I promised on my previous review, here is the review of my arrival experience; my family and I paid for superior/ Luxury hotel and they booked me World Elite taksin hotel that is far from even being a 5 start hotel.  Let me begin by telling you that no one speaks fluent English or Spanish, all you get is “I don’t know “. Supposedly the hotel gave us superior suites facing the street (tiny rooms with 2 twin beds). The room does not provide written information on which extensions to dial in case you need anything, no WiFi information, the phone don’t have the extensions labeled; we got 2 bottles of water per day for 2 people.The cherry on the top is that AC is not cooling and when I called them to get it fix or to get transferred to another suite with decent AC they told me that during winter time the AC don’t works and asked me to open my window to get fresh air.  So here we are with no AC and 2 bottles of water.  DO NOT waste time and money with Exoticca their customer services sucks and the hotel quality that they offered is not even worth.  Not I have to go out to buy water so we can stay hydrated."
2025-04-06,N/A,Ecuador/Galapagos/Guayaquil 2025,"In 2022, My family booked a trip to Egypt with Exoticca with so much excitement as it was a once-in-a -lifetime adventure for 16 of us! The flights were messed up 2 months before departure but the management came through and made it very appreciated by us.Therefore we decided to book with Exoticca last year for a trip to South America it was great until one excursion was cancelled without compensating us for the missing excursion until we asked for a substitute excursion.We then booked  a trip to Ecuador/Galapagos island/Guayaquil for June 2025 but it was altered to eliminate Guayaquil without advising us! After  many calls we were told that we would be given $270 for future trip with Exoticca for the “inconvenience”!Well after many more calls, we were informed that we never booked with Guayaquil initially!Well, we should have learned our lesson! We hope that something positive will happen before our date of departure as Exoticca now said to wait for their response. Stay tuned!Corrected booking number below:Booking ID EX-US2024321493At this point we have to forfeit our pre-purchased our excursions in Guayaquil as it is a she-said/he-said situation now. It is a very valuable lesson for us. We will no longer book our trip on the phone anymore. We are seasoned frequent travelers with many booking agencies this is the first discrepancy we had ever experienced. From now on we will only book with more reliable travel agents even if we have to pay more for more pleasant vacations."
2025-04-03,N/A,Non existent customer service,"My friend and I booked a trip to Guatemala for May this year. Having paid up my friend saw that the Foreign Office was telling people not to travel to the country and, in particular, to two areas we were due to visit with Exoticaa.We asked if we could transfer to another destination without these risks but Exoticaa refused so we decided to cancel via the online form.  Received an automated email with a reference number of 0362700 which said that someone would be in touch.No one contacted us at all so we chased up with another email to which we received no response. We rang customer service on 31st March and were given another case number 0364669 and we were told someone was working on it in 'another department.'  We asked to be put through to the 'other department' but were told this was not possible!It is now 3rd April and we have had no communication whatsoever from this company about our refund.Absolutely dreadful service given how quick Exoticaa are to request payment and to send reminder emails.You need to be customer friendly and efficient at all stages of booking even those where the customer is cancelling."
2025-04-03,N/A,Still trying to get written…,"Still trying to get written confirmation that name is changed on our trip and any charges incurred. Been 3 months now trying to sort this and I am so frustrated I can’t talk to anyone. Have not received any emails with new information. I am praying the trip is going to be better than customer service as this is appalling. PLEASE Exoticca sort this for me once and for all. Really bad that I have to come on here to get a response!Thanks for your reply, no email received on 26 March with options. Pls resend."
2025-04-03,N/A,Horrible Experience Booked a deluxe trip with Exoticca,"Booked a deluxe trip with Exoticca - thought they had their headquarters in the US - they do NOT.   All phone numbers go to Spain.   Our flight was extremely delayed and we missed connect to final destination.  Zero customer service - none.   Have been trying to get a refund - they offer $200 trip credit when we paid $8K for a deluxe trip.   Once you purchase don't expect any assistance.   I have reported them to the FTC, Consumer Protection Agency and the BBB - please do the same.  Companies like this need to be banned from doing business in the US.  Booking ID EX2025341069Your offer was a $200 trip credit - I paid $8,000 for the deluxe.   Your customer service is horrible so no you did nothing to try to get us to our destination.If Exoticca would put 1/100 th of the efforts toward customer service that you put into getting negative reviews removed - you may become a legitimate company."
2025-03-30,N/A,Poor Hotels.   Over 100% markup on everything.,"I am on a Exoticca trip in Costa Rica.   For what they charged, their hotels are crap.  They should be embarrassed. The TripAdvisor rating on the one hotel was absolutely horrible.   After staying at the hotel, I could see why.   For what Exoticca charged for the tour, we were completely ripped off.   I added up what the full retail prices would have been for the hotels, transfers, and tours,   They have marked everything up probably over 100%. They would have gotten better deals than full retail.   Our trip would have been less than 1/2 price if we had booked it ourselves. Our trip was without air fair, so it was easy to compare the actual costs to what they charged us."
2025-03-28,N/A,This was a bad trip,This was a bad trip.  Worst customer service.  Missed connecting flight (misplaced passport) Exoticca offered no help.  Suggested they might book us another flight at our expense which was actually the most expensive.  It rained every day of our tour and they had no alternate plans to our sloshing thru ponds of water.  Disgusting!  Never exoticca!!
2025-03-28,N/A,Not a pleasent experience with customer…,Not a pleasent experience with customer service. Agent do not listen. Not giving correct information.
2025-03-27,N/A,We were misguided by their flight…,"We were misguided by their flight itinerary informing us that personal and carryon baggage’s are included in our flight but when we checked in the airline, we had to pay $130 each carryon baggage one way. We paid $520 total for our airline round trip. It was a complete highway robbery."
2025-03-25,N/A,Hi I haven't been able to get through…,"Hi I haven't been able to get through to Exoticca at all I have been trying for days now to book a trip and get more information, I decided to look at this site to see reviews, they are mixed and looks like very poor customer service if anything goes wrong, however they do seem to respond to reviews, if the follow through I'm not sure, but if anyone from Exoticca reads this, I'd like a answer as to how to speak to someone re a trip."
2025-03-24,N/A,Very disorganized tour,"Very disorganized tour.  I missed a tour because the bus was late and our hotel did not have a clean room so we had to move hotels.  One of the Exoticca guides put us on the wrong transfer boat so we almost missed our bus.  Then one of the excursions I paid for was really bad.  It was a food and drink tasting tour.  We got one small appetizer and one drink.  The tour guide ate half of our appetizer and then made us pay, but it was all 'included' according to Exoticca.  I won't be traveling with them again.  Also we were not told that a porter would help us with our bags at the beach so we carried our own luggage in 90 degree weather across a long stretch of beach to find out hotel.  The first guide who was supposed to help us with the itinerary we almost missed at our hotel because he was just sitting on the couch in the lobby playing on his phone.  We had to go over to him to ask him if he was from Exoticca.  Then he barely gave us any information.  I would not suggest using them."
2025-03-24,N/A,I have come on here in desperation,"I have come on here in desperation. I have been trying for over a month to get through to customer services who put you in a queue and never answer. I have tried emailing three times, wait the five days Exoticca says to wait for a reply to get no answer and an automated survey asking how they did. The only reply I got was calling Sales who answer straight away but say they can’t help and put me back in the unanswerable queue. I am urgently trying to change a persons name on my booking. Please will someone help me!"
2025-03-21,N/A,baggage fraud,Booking states that flight baggage is included. I called to check with Exoticca and was assured if the boking says it is then they will honour it - now before the trip they say they are not - I am lucky i investigated this before the trip or would of had some high unexpected additional cost and airport embarrassment. I don't think they should lie to the customers and stick to what the booking says - this is fraud.
2025-03-20,N/A,Zero Customer Service - Headquarter office in Miami - NOT REGISTERED,"My wife and I  approved a ""deluxe"" travel plan to Morocco leaving Feb. 16. This itinerary had flight dates and times but no airline names. I requested airline names along with other information like the hotels I reviewed from itinerary were NOT 4 and 5 star rated hotels. Was assured they were and that I could not change them. I paid for the trip BUT when I received the itinerary the flight information changed dramatically - 8 hour layover at JFK - not acceptable. I contacted the sales person - Michael. NOTHING. I contacted via email and telephone customer service. Hold times over 45 minutes - all they could do was ""escalate"". They booked us on Jet Blue - not an airline I would ever use. The entire experience was horrible. Their customer service was non existent their feeble attempt to ""escalate"" produced nothing viable. I would NEVER USE THEM AGAIN NOR WOULD I RECOMMEND THEM. VERY DECEITFUL AND LIARS."
2025-03-19,N/A,February 19 between Johannesburg and…Nightmare in  SouthAfrica,"February 19 between Johannesburg and Kruger Our tour bus crashed  rolled over and landed on its side.20 occupants everyone hurt from fractured spine to broken necks stitches hip broken shoulders broken.We were left out in the rain for two hours then finally ambulances to a public hospital 2 hours away.  They could not handle twenty people so we were again ambulances to a private pay hospital 2 more hours away.It's been a month now and we have had no contact on what they are going to do for us.  Luggage was ruined glasses and phones lost and more details on the injuries once we got home.Exotica sub contracted trip to Amazing Africa, The quality expected from an exotica trip wasn't close. The accident was most likely do to driver error , so tab this time no one wants to claim responsibility.I have been in the hospital fora weekend now I have a wound pump in my leg from a large hole that I experienced .Our lives have been turned upside down let alone the reoccurring nightmare a bus flipping around.BE ware of any trip you bookend make sure your in the hands of exoticaALSO. Read the fine printing your contract."
2025-03-19,N/A,Read the fine print before booking,"I booked a trip this January to Africa leaving this April- with my mom and two aunts, for my mom’s birthday gift.We purchased our required documents, vaccinations etc already, paid the trip in full already - and couldn’t wait to go. I have two friends booked separately coming from Vancouver as well.We have waited and saved FOREVER to do this. Turns out you need to read the fine print- you have no rights, they treat you with disrespect, customer service is atrocious and hardly every calls back if even at all, over the course of a week my mom spoke with 12 different people- even asking for a manager 3 different times, one still never called back but had the audacity to send an email once- today- as per our last written complaint. The situation- My one aunt underwent extreme life threatening surgery and could no longer go (stomach)- the incision would not even be healed by our departure date. At the time of booking we EACH purchased individual cancelation insurance for the trip through exoticca. This insurance required a specific amount of time (30 days before departure) to cancel for credit only (thank god we thought) … let me tell you... When my aunt went to cancel for herself they told her that ALL of the people in our group had to cancel. We were not made aware of this at the time of booking, didn’t make sense as we all purchased separate insurance and paid separately for our trip. We were then told that there would be no room to re- book the same trip (also makes no sense because cancelling our 4 spots should free 4 spots?) and that it would not be at the price sold to us (possibly thousands more on top of the already thousands spent) if there was spots free. I could see this if we saved thousands and booked as a big group, but we were booked for the advertised price and not a group rate- paid individually… they dragged us out close enough to the point where our “30 day limit was almost reached and we were forced to go ahead and cancel, so that my aunt could also get her full credit. This company has completely lost all my respect and regard, they have been so unprofessional, my mom has spent hours on the phone, being hung up on and ignored. If I could give it zero stars I would. God forbid you need their help when your in a different county.  When you read the fine print just know that they can cancel you whenever they please and don’t have to reschedule or give you your money back, or provide you with an explication as to why. I’ll be pretty picky the next time I choose to spend my money, trust and time with a travel company."
2025-03-17,N/A,Don't book with Exoticca,"Don't book with Exoticca! Save yourself the money and headache.Exoticca is just an administrator booking tours through third parties. This is company is like a cheap airline that strips out everything to make it seem like you're getting a lower price but once you pay for the things you have to have, the total cost is actually more than if you went with a more inclusive and higher quality option.I booked an tour to Argentina and Brazil. The stops were Buenos Aires, Iguazu Falls, and Rio de Janeiro.When I did my original booking with Exoticca I requested Delta Economy but I got Economy Basic. They are different booking classes and Exoticca wouldn't do anything about it. During the tour I met a couple with my same itinerary from another US city. They paid $250 each ($500 total) to be on a different flight plan than originally purchased. They didn't get that flight plan even though the flights were available through the airline with only a $4 difference! No refund from Exoticca last I heard.The reservation says 4-star hotels but they were a far cry from 2-star motels at best.  The Buenos Aires hotel had stains and scuffs, dust and dirt everywhere on the floor, window sills, and corners. The tour bus literally had bugs crawling around. The tour guide was very friendly but the fact that the normal tour operation picks you up from the hotel but doesn't drop you back off at your hotel is insane. The tour guide made an exception for the American guests but if she hadn't we would have had to find our own way back from one of 3 drop-off points. The hotel restaurant was extremely limited and the menu wasn't in English.My first flight from Buenos Aires to Iguazu Falls was delayed multiple times (total of 6 hours) and no one from Exoticca or the arrival transfer company contact me to assure that I would still have transportation. When I finally contacted through WhatsApp it took over an hour to get a response. When I arrived in Iguazu Falls the driver had a sign that said Cuenca (local company) but not my name or Exoticca which made it difficult to identify.There were 3 couples and 1 other solo traveler all on the same Exoticca itinerary but all of our local flights (from Buenos Aires to Iguazu and then Iguazu to Rio) were booked separately so we were all traveling at different times, with different airlines.My flight from Iguazu Falls to Rio (only 2 hours direct) had a layover but the other travelers on the same tour had direct flights. The flight information in the app was incorrect so I ended up rushing from one flight to the next during the layover.When I arrived in Rio, the person coordinating transportation was standing with her back to where people were exiting, with her head down, looking at her phone. She barely spoke English, didn't help with bags, and just told me to follow her to the location where she called a driver who didn't speak English.Two of the couples traveling on the same itinerary paid extra to have an English speaking guide greet them at the Rio airport and give them a guided tour of the city. Neither got what they paid for! Only a non English speaking driver.The hotel in Rio was the last straw. I was placed in two absolutely disgusting rooms. I contacted Exoticca by WhatsApp and they contacted the local tour company. It took 3 hours to get a resolution and every time I contacted again to follow up I got a different person who asked the same questions. I was finally put in a different room that the hotel called ""luxury."" This room was newer so it was slightly cleaner but in no way was it luxury. There was mold in the bathrooms, cobwebs in the corners, dirt in the corners. Beds had sheets only, no blankets, stains on the pillows and curtains, scuffs on the walls.The first day of tours was good but they had the incorrect itinerary and the group was booked at two different restaurants for lunch.The tour guide on the second day was rude and kept getting annoyed at people asking him questions. He was clearly in a hurry and rushed us the entire time especially at lunch.Overall this experience was a lot of annoyance and the other travelers in the group experienced it too. Don't fall for the flashy website and sales. Just pay to use a better company with guides, entry fees, high quality hotels, and direct management (not a company using third parties)."

2025-03-13,N/A,We recently booked a tour with… Horrible tour company. Never use Exotica. They are not what they say. Avoid doing business with this company.  We recently booked a tour with Exoticca from Washington D,"We recently booked a tour with… Horrible tour company.Never use Exotica. They are not what they say. Avoid doing business with this company.We recently booked a tour with Exoticca from Washington DC to Costa Rica. Horrible experience with Exoticca. The hotels were horrible, they booked us on Avianca where everything was extra, including water and coffee.When we hiking to Volcano I injured my knee- it absolutely not safe! I have been traveling for over 55 years and this is the first time I have ever been stuck with this company and I have never had a worse trip. Abandoned on the first and last day and transported between cities without a guide for 3-4 hours. In 8 days only 2 and a half days all inclusive. And Avianca is just horrible.No driver who speaks English, everyone only speaks Spanish. Do not use Exoticca.Date of experience: 04-11 March 2025 this company will trap you into paying hidden fees. You can't check in for a flight earlier than 24 hours and the baggage fees are huge - I had to pay an extra $260 roundtrip for carry on!!! Booking: US-EX2024315054"
2025-03-26,N/A,Terrible customer Service,"This company has the worst customer service. We upgraded our flights for one trip but they applied it to a different trip. This happened 3 weeks ago. I have called, chatted online and it still has not been resolved.The communication is poor at best.On a side note, we just returned from Egypt with them. We had the most amazing tour guide, Noha. In Cairo.It’s unfortunate they have such terrible customer service and communication. We will not travel with them anymore.Update to this saga. Never heard from Exoticca. I called today 3/20 and was sent an email that somehow there were no upgrades available on our flights. We were offered to take an alternate flight which causes us to have to change our flight from Seattle to home or just be refunded for our requested upgrade. Bottom line is they didn’t want to pay the difference due to their mistake. We leave on Tuesday and still have no resolution.Do not use this company. They do not care about the customer after they take your money.Final update…. Our flights were never upgraded. They have yet to refund our money that we paid for the upgrade as they are claiming we were upgraded. I called the airlines, we were booked on basic economy. Their customer service staff also agreed that we were not upgraded. The department that is in charge refused to do anything about it. No one ever reached out even after they left a comment about resolving the issue."
2025-03-12,N/A,Warming-terrible customer service to make a change to flights to arrive 5 days before tour 5/20/25,"My friend and I decided to book below trip. From the United States. Booked it March 7 and the next day March 8, 2025 kept calling & calling to advise them to change the flight to five days before the tour starts on the 20th and have been a horrible service experience. Very unwilling to help you.  They keep claiming they cannot make the change to arrive earlier so we could venture to some other country or other places close to Albania before the tour starts. I do not recommend this company because they have terribly customer services and is very hard to get a hold of them.  They make you wait half to an  hour  and days to respond or speak to them. Since 8Mar2025 till today, 13Mar 2025 and keep telling me the same thing they cannot change the flight to arrive there earlier. Which I think is not true. Because I work as a travel agent and if a passenger wanted to arrive earlier, they would be able to make a change, specially since it was the next day 24 hours before we booked the flight.Dreamy road trip through the Balkans - Albania, Montenegro,Croatia & BosniaAlbania, Montenegro, Croatia & Bosnia in 11 Days 9 Nights in DestinationFrom Tirana, the capital of Albania, head to Lezhë to visit the Mausoleum of Skanderbeg. Next, Montenegro, to explore its historic cities and Perast, the Venice of the Adriatic Sea. Head on to Croatia coastline, to visit Dubrovnik, Mostar and the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I just hope the accommodation and the tour turns out to be good. I am totally dissatisfied with the fact that we call 24 hours after we book & they claimed that the arrival date to five days earlier cannot be change. Every company I used before which has only been 3-4 times like Gate 1 Travel,  etc. would accommodate and change your flight to an earlier flight if you wanted to arrive earlier."
2025-03-12,N/A,Pricing process,"I came across today the “Treasures of Anatolia” tour on Exoticca’s website, and while the itinerary looks absolutely amazing — covering historic gems across Turkey with well-planned accommodations and transfers — I was surprised by the pricing structure when trying to book. For 1 room with 2 adults, the tour is listed at a competitive £999 per person, which seems like a great value for what’s included. However, when I added a baby to the booking (under 2 years old), the price went down to £699. That’s an unusually. It increased questions about how pricing is calculated,It’s a bit disappointing because the tour itself seems very well-curated, but even if the destination and package look promising, but the pricing is a definite downside."
2025-03-12,N/A,On holiday be warned Exoticca are anonymous.,Recent holiday in Columbia awful sub standard hotels - never a rep available either at hotel or on the phone - make no mistake you are alone.   Hotels change during trip.   Charged excessive amount for extra 4 days at last hotel - £742.44 - when could be booked locally at   £64 per night.    All in all dreadful service and very expensive for 2 star hotels.   UK-EX2025336240.
2025-03-11,N/A,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Okay, I booked a trip for my wife and I for our 20 year anniversary.  I got the email showing everything we were paying for and what we were going to do and stay. My wife noticed that her name was misspelled and I put her birth middlename on the ticket not what was on her license and passport.  SO I messed up on the middle name.  Regardless, I started calling this company weeks in advance to get this fixed.  I do not have time to sit on hold all day because I have a job. I went online and tried to fix that way and during all of this I never got a call back.  No once!! SO now its days away from leaving and Ive called the airlines to get it switched and it only cost $27 dollars to change the name on the ticket. A simple stroke of the key and pay for the mistake. But no this company is trying to charge me $ 4900 to reissue all new tickets.  SO yes I would not recommend using them due to the poor customer service and they will lie and say the airlines is charging more to change a name."
2025-03-08,N/A,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANYCompletely mis-sold a trip to China.Reassured that  adding hold luggage would be no problem.This is NOT the case, I was given the wrong information and emails to customer support failed to even recognise the problem. Told it's my problem.It  has cause me major stress and I've lost money despite being an rxperi traveller.stress and difficulty.After having to write to Exoticca to find out the cost of hold luggage on this holiday - and waiting over two weeks for a response - apparently we cannot guarantee that the hold luggage wont be left at a transit airport or know how much it will cost for it to complete it's journey to the holiday destination. This is just astounding! Or we spend a 15 day holiday with just enough clothes, toiletries, snorkels and diving masks that will fit in a cabin bag. Ridiculous and very, very poor."
2025-03-08,N/A,Be very aware of hold baggage.,"Booked the holiday of a lifetime - no problem.Website clearly states ""Additional luggage can be added after you have completed your booking"". This is NOT the case, at least not without stress and difficulty.After having to write to Exoticca to find out the cost of hold luggage on this holiday - and waiting over two weeks for a response - apparently we cannot guarantee that the hold luggage wont be left at a transit airport or know how much it will cost for it to complete it's journey to the holiday destination. This is just astounding! Or we spend a 15 day holiday with just enough clothes, toiletries, snorkels and diving masks that will fit in a cabin bag. Ridiculous and very, very poor."
2025-03-05,N/A,Can't access support during trip,"The pre-trip communication was excellent. They were sending updated information regularly and confirming all the activities and pick ups. Once it got to the flight, baggage was not included. This ended up increasing our cost by 558.88 Canadian dollars. That's a large unexpected cost. I think that's part of how they advertise cheaper costs. I tried to get support from them regarding this but did not hear back. At our hotel in Jaco, Costa Rica, we were provided with a room with a view of a large apartment building, and could not see the beach or the mountains. I asked for a room change and was told no. I reached out to Exoticaa to assist on my behalf and they did not respond to my concerns. You pay for a guided tour but receive no support during the trip if anything goes wrong. They essentially plan a trip for you, and then if anything goes wrong you are on your own. Buyer beware. And verify baggage costs as this will add anywhere from 15-20% of your trip costs."
2025-05-11,N/A,"Esy to purchase, no CS (NONE) post purchase","I have not traveled with them yet - this rating is for their Customer service after sales before travel.Getting to their Sales Agents was very easy and the process to buy one of their tours was efficient and effective.After that, the Customer service is horrendous!Calling in to CS entailed a 90 mins hold time - no thank you!Reverting to chat entailed a 32 mins wait time, only to be flipped to 1.5 hrs after 20 mins!!Writing to them would entail a wait of (hopefully) 4-7 business days before they respond.All this in search for simple answers to a few follow up questions!I suppose if the tours are well organized, then CS is immaterial at the end of the day. I dread the possibility of needing to reach out to them during the tour!Until I experience otherwise, I cannot recommend Exoticca for their non-existent CS!EDIT 5/11: Am back from the tour.  The tours went well with the local agents (Beyond Jordan / Planet Tours in Egypt). We enjoyed ourselves and had a good time, albeit it was a very packed trip.My luggage missed the incoming flight on the way to Jordan, and I reached out to Exoticca for help via their help link - no response to date. Luckily the ground agent in Jordan was helpful and we sorted the missing luggage the next day."
2025-03-03,N/A,This company keeps saying call customer…,This company keeps saying call customer service i was on hold to day for over an hour and could not contact them they emailed me to contact but that person you can never reach him or her i ended up buying an air ticket on my own instead of the hassle a loss of $1000+never again this travel company
2025-03-07,N/A,Price was cheap and that should have…,"Price was cheap and that should have been a red flag. You get what you pay for. We stop at some significant places and were beautiful but no time to actually see anything up close. Every time the guide said we had an hour free to eat and use restroom, she kept talking until  30 people only had 10 minutes of free time. Some of the orders of destinations could have been reversed to give more time. Hotels were OK, clean for the most part, ease of access to dinning in the evenings. At destination locations we were rushed through areas of great photo opps and too much time spent in areas of no meaning. Have traveled Europe several times on our own and I guess we will go back to that. Overall experience? Will not travel wit Exottica againBooking ID is 2024308780"
2025-03-01,N/A,Valli Canada customer service Exotica travels,"Valli CanadaI have booked a tour in May, 2025 for Peru with exotica. I asked them not to include us night tour of Cusco. When the itinerary was sent it was included. My middle name is spell at wrong. The flight times have not been given.I asked about paying extra for checked baggage and I have not had an answer.Instead I have had a reminder for the rest of the money owing. If this is the case before we start our trip, I am wondering how our trip is going to be. I have tried to call them and have been put on hold for 25 to 30 minutes at a time several times. Their customer service is quite lacking in communication and service. I was going to book another trip but now I have second thoughts."
2025-02-26,N/A,Morocco: disappointed,"Several issues with this trip (~10 days in Morocco, Feb 2025):-The tour was advertised as requiring good physical status due to moderate walking, however the tour had near zero walking and 90% of the time was spent on a bus. This is not what we were looking for.-Most of the ""charm"" hotels were solid 2 star hotels with not very reassuring reviews. The experience proved the above.-Too many cities and territory covered with little to no time to really explore the place on your own. Only one day was on our leasuere-Extremely overpriced places where we were taken for lunch-Visited several overpriced tourist traps where there was a full display of sells and there was minimal room for self search of shops or decisions about on what to spent out $-Tour guide was not the best, sadly. He was very upfront about his expectations on tips from day 1-Additional tips were needed for local guides in addition to our tour guideNot recommended"
2025-02-25,N/A,Unreliable and terrible customer service with no personal touch,"Dealing with them has been excruciatingly painful so far. There is no personal touch or a sense of reliability. Their wait times on the phone to answer any question is horrible, much longer than the estimated time that they give you. We haven’t been on this trip yet but already had an issue with our flight booking initially which they booked us on basic Economy instead of Economy without even telling us that is what we were getting. And then to change that from basic economy to regular economy we had to contact the airline and pay upgrade fees to get to main cabin class. Exoticca was of no help and they said there is nothing they can do about it.Our trip is coming up in April 2025 but they have now changed our hotels after having committed to the hotels that we had reviewed with them in depth and they did not even inform us of this change. Their alternative hotels they have booked us are NOT the same level or category as what they had initially offered during the booking.  We are now waiting to speak to a customer service rep for over 1 hour and yet no one answered. To our utter dismay, we finally hung up. We have travelled to many places in the world and dealt with many travel companies and this is by far the worst experience we have had so far. We are afraid of any issues we may run into through this trip and their unreliability makes us very nervous. We DO NOT RECOMMEND them to anyone!!!!"
2025-02-23,N/A,Don’t use,"Don’t use, they will charge you extras. I booked a holiday to China. I entered my name 3 times and it still got it wrong. I have to pay £665. I explained I do have a disability and therefore did see the error. They did not answer my question about their policy on errors made by disabled people and said I still. Holiday is already ruined before it has started and it’s a big birthday! Please don’t use this company!"
2025-02-21,N/A,EXTREMELY DECEITFUL AND ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I approved a ""deluxe"" travel plan to Morocco leaving Feb. 16.  This itinerary had flight dates and times but no airline names.  I requested airline names along with other information like the hotels I reviewed from itinerary were NOT 4 and 5 star rated hotels.   Was assured they were and that I could not change them.  I paid for the trip BUT when I received the itinerary the flight information changed dramatically - 8 hour layover at JFK - not acceptable.   I contacted the sales person - Michael.  NOTHING.   I contacted via email and telephone customer service.  Hold times over 45 minutes - all they could do was ""escalate"".  They booked us on Jet Blue - not an airline I would ever use.  The entire experience was horrible.   Their customer service was non existent their feeble attempt to ""escalate"" produced nothing viable.  I would NEVER USE THEM AGAIN NOR WOULD I RECOMMEND THEM.  VERY DECEITFUL AND LIARS."
2025-02-27,N/A,Extremely Disappointing Experience with…,"Extremely Disappointing Experience with Exoticca TravelMy wife and I, along with two friends, recently completed a 13-day trip to Greece in October 2024, and it turned out to be one of the most disappointing travel experiences we've ever had. Greece had always been a dream destination for us, but Exoticca Travel’s mismanagement and poor customer service turned our long-anticipated vacation into a frustrating ordeal.Major Issues with Our Trip:🔹 Unnecessary Itinerary Disruptions: Upon arriving in Athens, we were informed that our entire trip had been rearranged due to an impending ferry strike—something that reportedly happens every year. Despite this being a predictable event, Exoticca made last-minute changes to our itinerary and accommodations, causing significant frustration.🔹 Terrible Communication & Customer Service: Throughout our trip, Exoticca’s customer service was nearly nonexistent. Despite multiple attempts to get assistance, responses were slow or unhelpful. When we called to complain about our itinerary, we were told to use the app—only to find out it was never updated. We had to constantly check with hotel front desks just to know where we were supposed to go next.🔹 Subpar Accommodations: The hotels we were promised did not match the descriptions in our package. Some were dirty and lacked basic amenities. Out of all the places we stayed, only one could be rated above 1.5 stars. One hotel was located directly behind a nightclub, and the loud music and pounding bass kept us up until 2 AM—despite us having a 6 AM departure the next morning.🔹 Disorganized & Exhausting Transportation Arrangements: Transportation logistics were a complete mess. We experienced long waits, chaotic transfers, and rushed schedules that left little time to actually enjoy our destinations. A prime example: our ferry from Santorini to Paros left at 1 PM and arrived at 7 PM, giving us just enough time for a quick dinner before an early morning departure. We saw Paros for a grand total of 30 minutes—at night.🔹 Lack of Accountability & Poor Problem Resolution: When we raised concerns, Exoticca showed no willingness to resolve the issues. No compensation was offered, and we felt completely ignored. Even after being assured that someone would contact us about our complaints, over three months later, we are still waiting for a response—except for a follow-up email encouraging us to complete another booking.🔹 Deceptive Credit Offer & Misrepresentation: One of the main reasons we booked with Exoticca was the promise of a $4,500 per couple credit for future travel. Exoticca misrepresented how this credit could be used. We were explicitly advised—and had confirmation from our travel agent—that the full $4,500 would be applied to our next booking, which was a key factor in our decision to book the trip in the first place. However, when we attempted to use the credit, we discovered it was capped at $450 per couple per trip. To fully use the credit, we’d have to book 10 trips in three years—an unreasonable and misleading offer that feels like a classic bait-and-switch tactic. Exoticca clearly was not upfront about how this incentive/promotion worked, and had we known the truth, we would never have booked with them.Final Verdict: Avoid Exoticca TravelThis was our first experience with Exoticca, and it will certainly be our last. Instead of a stress-free and enjoyable vacation, we endured mismanagement, misleading promises, and poor customer service. I strongly advise against booking with Exoticca Travel. If you value transparency, reliable service, and a smooth travel experience, look elsewhere.Booking # CA-EX2024266898My travel agent will give you my phone#"
2025-03-12,N/A,Pre-trip Nightmare,"In all of my dealings with Exotica I had let them know about my mobility issues.  I booked a trip to Portugal for late February 2025.  In mid January 2025 I confirmed that I could use a mobility scooter on my trip.  About eight days before the trip I asked some questions about the mobility scooter and the hotel.  Exotica never answered my questions and instead told me that they may not be able to accommodate me.  This was seven days before the trip.  I replied and pointed out that I had already been told this was okay.  Since then I have sent several emails and spoken to them on the telephone.  I have been told they are working on it, it has been resolved, they have pushed the matter forward and so on.  Of course nothing in writing, no phones calls from them and when I requested to speak to a manager, they promised me it would happen and I am still waiting.I am concerned that when we go I will end up battling the tour guide, while it is not his fault; I could end up not being able to go on the tour; there will be other problems; and if there are in country issues I will not get a response from Exotica.  I have noted many posts on many forums that are talking about the same or similar problems.  It also seems that Exotica says they will do something or pay something and then just ignore their resolutions.  It appears that they believe people will just go away.The trips look good but their customer service is extremely poor.  I will let people know what happens with the actual trip.If you have had experiences with Exotica (good or bad) please post about it.Reference #CA-EX2024288728With one day to go, the trip is supposed to leave tomorrow, Exotica is still ""working on it"".  I have to wonder if this is a scam and they are hoping I will cancel the trip.  That way they can blame it on me.Despite all my attempts to email and call Exotica; and despite my suggestions to resolve this all I have heard from Exotica is ""we are working in it"".  While waiting for our flight to Portugal at the airport I arranged for an electric scooter.  We still had not heard from Exotica, we did not know if we were going to be able to take the tour (once in Portugal), we didn't know if we were going to be able to use the mobility device, we didn't know if the tour guide knew about this and we didn't know what Exotica was doing.  As we were boarding the plane I got an email from Exotica that they could rent us a wheel chair or scooter.This was too little too late.  I have to wonder of their team can read and understand all of the information we had sent them.  We were also extremely concerned, given Exotica's track record, if we were to have problems on the trip.  This company has failed up completely.  We also believe that all of the advertising and assurances about caring for their customers, responding to customers and trip protection is false and not to be believed.We won't say don't sure them but be very careful as even written promises may be broken."
2025-02-16,N/A,Appalling customer service,"Appalling customer service. Inflexibility, unable to apply logic and empathise. Tardy responses with satisfactory explanations. Robotic replies. Unsatisfactory substitutions. We are now starting our holiday in a poorer frame of mind than we would have liked. I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this company. What may seem like an appealing headline price is a false economy."
2025-02-15,N/A,can't find some of the review trips,"Hi I've been reading a lot of reviews which are positive but some have no mention on which trip they went on, so feedback doesn't give an good overview or am I just missing something"
2025-02-09,N/A,better response to customer requirement…,better response to customer requirement the person booking the travel disappears and you get no help from any one very bad experience
2025-02-06,N/A,Terrible accommodations,"Things have been going from bad to worse on our 17 day trip with Exoticca.  From unsafe shuttle to airport to awful hotel after awful hotel - after we paid for superior/luxury rooms - I would recommend that you look at another travel company.  They do not address issues, rather, they pass them on to their local staff who can’t do much for unsanitary hotels and we are left with bad travel experiences.  If you are looking for a pleasant trip, this is not the company to go with.   wish I was home already"
2025-02-12,N/A,Haven't even gotten off the ground yet and.......,"Haven't even got off the ground yet and already I'm getting frustrated.  Trip booked in Dec; signing into site worked once.  Now can't log into site or app no matter what I try.(resetting password/re-registering) the only information I do get is that I have not booked any trips.  When I notified Exottica about this I got no response. Hope the actual trip works out better.**Update 2/8/25:  ""Amazingly"" sign on work shortly after the post.  HOWEVER, after writing down the username and password that worked, and trying to use it today it no longer works.  States password incorrect; so tried to reset password.  Just for giggles I entered the password I just used and it shows up not to use the ""current"" password ???  How can a password be incorrect AND current at the same time?**Update:  Exottica contacted me via email with the solution to fix the problems.    Now to start packing :(Thank you for being able to resolve this as painlessly as possible."
2025-02-06,N/A,Miss sold holiday,"When I first made my enquiry with the travel consultant for Exoticca back last year I made it clear that although l'd be traveling by myself I didn't want to be on my own. I wanted to travel as an organised tour group with a group director/coordinator and same group of people travelling as one group. Even after booking the trip to Costa Rica l rang back again with concerns over the booking confirmation details and she reassured me in writing in an email that my tour would be FULLY escorted and with a tour coordinator and same group of people. There would also be a welcome meeting on arrival. So after that reassurance I remained happy with my booking.Then the problems started withmy flights and my last one coming home being cancelled. I rang up to discuss it and was told after booking the trip they don't have anything to do with the flights and l'd have to sort it myself. I booked the tour as a package do this was a shock but she was adamant she couldn't help me. I rang the airline and they said they couldn't help me because l'd booked through a travel agency and they should sort it. I ended up having to put a formal complaint in to the customer service department and after many weeks i eventually had a new flight, plus they arranged a different flight going out to San Jose to half an hour earlier because they had me landing at 10.30pm when my tour started before breakfast the following day. So half anhour earlier was better than nothing.I was promised they'd sort my hold luggage out nearer the time and again this was something they let me down with and I ended up taking just hand luggage.To top it off I got on the holiday and I ended up on my OWN. Only seeing people on excursions. None of the above mentioned happened. The welcome meeting was a letter. How you ask a letter advice I don't know,it was rubbish. I felt very disappointed and depressed and made contact with Exoticca who tried fobbing me off saying I hadn't been given wrong information. But after disclosing the email I had they offered me £150 in credit which i refused. I've asked for it in monetary value which has just materialised.I made the best of a bad situationand enjoyed the hotels even though they were some distance from amenities and I enjoyed the excursions.But ultimately I will never be using this company in future again. Please be careful if you like to travel as part of a group because they're just a booking agent and the tours are NOT FULLY escorted."
2025-02-04,N/A,After sale service appalling,"Case ref 03502637Booked a safari with return flights to & from Heathrow, the booking came through with flight out from Heathrow but returning to Gatwick.Raised it as an issue on 18th Jan, have chased repeatedly with no resolution. Emailed the CEO, no response.Still no resolution to what should be a simple issue, not even an update. Appalling customer service. Now writing this review so people can see how bad their after sales care is but also in the hope of getting a resolution on the flights either that or a full refund of everything I've paid so I can actually book a trip with a company that treats its customers with respect."
2025-02-03,N/A,Bad tour leader,"I live in Italy and my family from the US came last year to visit me and traveled with Exotica.We were all very disappointed especially with  the tour leader who was not even Italian, had a strong Russian accent, and knew very little about the country and the culture.  She was also unkind and spoke poorly of the country and that put the entire group in a bad mood.Italy deserves better."

2025-02-05,N/A,Awful itinerary and worse customer service because of company rules. Plus roosters crowing outside my hotel room almost constantly,"I am currently on a trip to peru, Ecuador and galapagos islands.  Exoticca has been wasting my time like it is their job. A couple days ago I went on an optional excursion in the sacred valley. We left our hotel and went to a llama farm textile place about 40 or 45 minutes from the hotel. We had been to a similar place on our way to the sacred valley from Cusco but ok. We proceed to a scenic lookout spot. Nice. After that we travel all the way back past the hotel we stayed at to some cool inca ruins. We leave there have lunch go back by the hotel that we were already checked out of by the way. We proceed to another cool spot before going back by the scenic lookout spot and the llama textile place again on our way back to cusco. In who's mind does that make sense?We asked the guides and they said the had tried to fix it but Exoticca won't let them. Now I am at the airport waiting for a flight to lima. There are many flights going to lima,but they will not try to make your trip better or more efficient as a rule after the flights are confirmed.  My biggest problem is when I get to lima where I just was a couple days ago they are transferring me to the far from the airport hotel I was at several days ago. I will get there, sleep. Wake up and transfer back to the airport. I realized how incredibly stupid this is and tried to get them to do anything to fix their messed up itinerary but they will do nothing. I am not the only one. We are mad. We paid them to waste our time. I am not even half way through this trip. So I really hope the itinerary improves. Exoticca at least for this trip is garbage.  Update. 12 hours in lima. Over an hour and a half travel back and forth to hotel. 3 hours yesterday in airport. 4 hour in airport tomorrow. I let them know how ridiculous this was before it happened. But they don't care about their customers.  Many people in my group moved earlier from cusco and said there were plent of empty seats. Like I said there were flights all day. They need to send a rep on these trips and make them right. Either a closer to the airport hotel. Move me to ecuador right when you transfer me back and eliminate a day from the trip that is just a wasted time day. Or at least move people earlier so they could enjoy time in lima. I really hope they quit wasting my time though. A lot of this trip left.UpdateUnfortunately thing got worse. I am at the blue marlin hotel on san Cristobal island galapagos.  Right outside my window there are chicken and roosters coops. They pretty much constantly make noise from 4am to 8pm. I am sleep deprived and angry. Last night and don't know if something scared them but they woke me up at 1:20am. Plus I believe I got a mild case of food poisoning from the already awful breakfasts they serve at the blue marlin. I felt fine except sleep deprivation when I ate their breakfast. Unfortunately I was going on a boat tour after. I was fine snorkeling at kicker rock. Than we stopped for pics at another spot. Still fine. When we stopped for lunch I starting getting ill. I was so thirsty but anytime I put water in my belly in was just emptying right out. It was not motion sickness as I am do a lot of walleye fishing off a much smaller boat. The only reason I said mild version is because after emptying my stomach 6 or 7 times I was able to keep the last 2 glasses of water down while still on the boat and haven't vomited again since. Of course I haven't tried to eat again yet just water with electrolytes. I won't be trying the blue marlin breakfast this morning either.I wish I could post a video on here of the chicken coops. They are so loud and so constant. I sent one to exotica and they said they would look into it when they finally got back to me. But there solution was asking the front desk. Which I already did. Or contact what must be there guide partners on san Cristobal island which I guess neither of us know how to do. This was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime I am mad at how badly this has gone though. A total nightmare."
2025-01-25,N/A,TOTAL CRAP COMPANY,"WE HAVE NOT EVEN GONE ON OUR TRIP, AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF SHIT HAPPENING....., THIS COMPANY IS TOTAL CRAP.....THEY DO NOT OFFER ASSISTANCE LIKE THEY, YOU ARE OM YOUR OWN... GO TO ANOTHER TOOR COMPANY.. THIS WAS IS TOTAL SCHEIT......"
2025-01-23,N/A,Affordable comes at a price,"The two starts are for the relative affordability (Black Friday sale) and our tour guide Lucia, who was absolutely amazing and the best part of the trip. having said that, I encountered many issues:the hotel selections were not great, at least in my trip since I know other people have had better options.  particularly in Florence- being by the airport for some reason, almost 30 min by car from downtown at a costly 50-60 euros. the hotel in Rome was a bit better, but not ideal- still was difficult to move around especially since some of the transports are included- I knew this, but even for the optional tours you pay for! they are also overpriced for what they offer, akin to selling expensive popcorn at the theater- I understand they're a company and have to profit, but it feels ridiculous to pay 2x  the rate for the same tours you can book on your ownThere were 36 of us and there has been exoticca tours with up to 50+ people, which makes it miserable and you end up spending a considerable amount of time waiting on people. 15-20 would be more manageable here, especially because of how insane this itinerary is! We had way too many stops and we start very early, I'm exhausted at the end and it took a lot of the joy away from the experience. All the extra stops are unnecessary,  meaning we would arrive at the main cities at 6-7 pm and therefore only had one day in both Florence and Venice.on top of that I did not receive a refund for having to switch hotels in Florence, and the customer service left a lot to be desired, basically telling me ""that's it we told you no"" but not offering any other alternatives at all. they were pretty abrupt, even saying that hotels were ""a personal preference"" because people visiting a city effectively for a day want to be away from all the attractions? I was shocked by how bad and almost rude the customer service in general was, outside of Lucia our tour guide."
2025-01-22,N/A,PAID FOR 17 DAYS - GOT 9!!!  SO UPSET!,"In October I booked and paid for a 17 day trip to Japan for my husband and I.  We are beyond excited!  BUT - last week when looking through all my documentation, receipts, itinerary - which also say ""17 DAY TRIP""  The dates didn't add up.  We leave April 13 and come home 9 days later!  I contacted Exoticca immediately and was told they would fix it.  Today I got an email (no phone call as requested) stating they changed all my documentation to read that I have a 9 day trip!  Of course I am beyond unhappy!  So I contacted them again and have asked to speak to a supervisor.  I was told I would be called back today and it would be made right - but......  NOTHING."
2025-01-22,N/A,I am currently in Argentina travelling…,"I am currently in Argentina travelling in a group of 10 we were booked a terrible an obviously cheap flight as per Exoticca SOP! We have to leave our hotel at 2:40am for a 6am flight. This would mean we arrive in calafate at 9am ith no access to a hotel until after 2/3pm. We are travelling with a child. I have gone ahead today and waited at the Argentina airlines office in Buenos Aires to try a change the flight I was told that I could request a refund on the website. I’d get 75% back. I just wanna make sure from Exoticca that I was going to get the money back to me. They’re refusing to give it to me in which case I would be able to book my own flights to the next destination and would only cost me $75 above what I’ve already paid to Exoticca.. I am currently speaking to them in C2 and they’re refusing to help me as usual claiming I cannot get a refund, which is contrary to what I was told at the Argentinian airline office.Once again, incredibly disappointed, I also had another group member with me who witnessed the whole conversation She too is on that ridiculous flight and she is travelling from MacawPlease be advised I have gone to the Argentinian airlines office in Buenos Aires and was told that it is possible to get a refund which I tried to do. I then contacted Exoticca in situ and was told firstly that they could do nothing and then when I explained that I was told by the Argentinian airlines rep that I was entitled to 75% return which I would then apply myself to new flights with jet bondi I was told again by Exoticca that I would not be given my money on the return request as per there rules!!!!! What a terrible company forcing us to fly on the cheapest flight and then when I try to change it on my own not helping me or returning my funds!!!!!"
2025-01-20,N/A,Currently,"Currently, we are travelling through South America and as a group of 10 have just noticed that we are being forced to leave Buenos Aires on our day of leisure for a 6 AM flight to calafate - this means leaving the hotel @ 2:30 am and arriving at a substandard hotel with ZERO amenities and a check in time of 3pm leaving us with no home for an extended period of time. As per usual, Exoticca style we’ve reached out to them, to the agency in Argentina to Argentinian airlines and to exotica WhatsApp Nobody seems to be willing to help us. There are several other flights available leaving at a later time, however unfortunately, exotica as usual, looking for the cheapest option has Caused their travellers, extraordinary amount of grief and an immense amount of lost time.The group consists of travellers from Toronto, macaw and Colorado! We are all looking to change this flight AND NOBODY IS WILLING TO HELP US!"
2025-01-19,N/A,No Customer Service,"We booked our trip with Michael at Exotticca and he was very helpful while selling us our vacation. I received an email from an airline that wasn't the one we booked saying we were flying with them. It's an airline that I dislike very much because of problems from previous flights with them. I emailed Michael asking about this change. No response for 5 days. I emailed him again and still no response. After more than a week of waiting I tried to call the 24/7 phone line. I went through all the prompts and was on hold for 30 minutes and then it hung up on me. I called again and was on hold for about 10 minutes and I got tired and hung up. I called again, but this time I pushed a button saying I wanted to book a trip and I had a live person in less than 50 seconds. I tried to explain my problem and asked for help. He said I had to use the other prompts and talk to customer service. I explained that no one will pick up the phone and my agent wont answer my emails. He said he would get someone. He put me on hold and I was there for 35 minutes and no one answered. I've tried emailing customer service and all I get is a standard reply saying they are very busy and be patient. I've emailed customer service more that 10 times asking for help and a call so I can get this resolved, but nothing. In the standard email they say they are very interested in my problems, but it's all been talk and no action. I don't know what will happen if there is a real emergency? If no one will help before we leave what will happen if we have a problem on our trip? I have delt with a lot of travel agencies in my life, but none as bad as Exoticca. We will never use them again."
2025-01-16,N/A,Exottica deceptive practices,This company has very dishonest and deceptive practices. My wife and I had booked a trip last year to go to the Phillipines (flex package) however i had to be hospitalised and called 2 weeks before our trip to cancel or to rebook for this year. They refused to rebook our trip and gave us 1535 dollars on our 6000 dollar paid package in wallet credit. We are presently trying to use our wallet credits to book our next trip however they are deducting our credits (1535 + 771 ) despite contacting them to have these amount returned to our wallet and allowing us to use our wallet credits to book our new trip in August 2025. I have personally spoken to the Customer service John and he was supposed to escalate this and promised to have my wallet credit returned however they have not done so.I will definitely take this up with the BBB and FBI to inform them of this company deceptive practices with attempt to defraud travelers.
2025-01-16,N/A,Guatemala 1/16/2025,"Review tipsI have a trip scheduled to depart for Guatemala tomorrow 1/16/2025. I've contacted their customer service several times to let them know that I have the flu and all the goodies that come with it: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, and chills. I've asked to change to another date. I keep getting tossed around and ignored. This means that I will be boarding the plane and touring while sick as a dog and contagious. I feel sorry for anyone else scheduled to be on this trip as this flu is horrible and unaffected by the flu vaccine.My apologies to anyone who may be affected by this. I suggest you direct all complaints and medical bills to Exoticca.Hopefully the rest of the trip will go well."
2025-01-14,N/A,They do not Respond,"I am glad I read all the online reviews before I finalized my trip with them. That saved me.I sent them an email with questions. They have not responded, yet they kept spamming m to finalize my booking. I was about to do it when I decided to checked online reviews. I am so thankful I did.They lost my business as well as my family (5 Adults)."
2025-01-14,N/A,We haven’t even started our trip with…,"Please note my review here is actually taking place live I am still on the trip with Exoticca and I have been providing updates to Exoticca’s replies and making sure that anyone thinking of booking with Exoticca to be aware of  the problems I am having !!Saturday 11th JanuaryWe haven’t even started our trip with exoticca and already there are problemsWe made requests at the time of booking for a) gluteen free options b) seats allocation on flights c) wheelchair accessSadly none of the requests were done or flowed up with the airline Totally unprofessional disappointing and to add to this trying to call the 24/7 phone number to sort this out on Saturday meets with a message saying customer service is available!January 12thAnd by the way exottica booking us seniors a flight that leaves Panama to Quinto at 18.30 pm rather than 15.30 is no fun leaving us waiting at the airport since 2 pm for the flight .. you like doing things cheap but an earlier flight would have been much better to give us time to rest at the hotel  by arriving at 9.30 pm arriving at the quinto airport than another 45 minutes drive to the hotel is not the best service also having to get up at 7 am for the meeting at 8 am the on the 13th is no joke !! Having been tracking since 4 am today and only yesterday finding out that exotica had not made the proper arrangements..January 13thUpdate in response to exoticca reply belowExoticca response is full of excuses and lies about these flights!First of allA) At no time at the time of booking did the agent give us these flights times otherwise I would have made sure to get the correct flights .. or not bother booking the trip .. tell me who in Their right mind would want inbound flights which take a  longer to arrive !And who in the right mind would want to out going lights to arrive in Quito so late knowing that they have to be up by 5.30 am the next day  when they were already up by 4 am to catch the outbound ?What we had mentioned was the gluten free, disability request for booking seats!I called Exocticca several times to make sure that they have been done … they said they will take care of it but they didn’tB) so Exoticca is publicly telling lies that exotica had made arrangements for seats allocation gluten free option and disability support etc .. when I called Copa personally we found ourselves with no seat allocation no disability arrangements have been made no transpiration at the hotel was arranged no gluten request etc so Exocticca had not done what they said they will do or they stated they did !I hate it when companies such as exotica tell lies to cover them mistakes and this is one an example of how companies should not behave!!They rely on customers and certainly they do not serve one start from me because they failed to support me as a customer !I am dissatisfied by their response as it’s a lie ! I am not happy with the flights they gave us especially the inbound to canada flight!We are seniors and these flight booking by Exoticca are absolutely diabolical to put us in such positionI emailed them asking them to change the flights to get us back to canada on the same day 28th and you can see from their response they are doing nothing about itSo I am asking them again openly here on this trustpilot review to change the flight at no cost to us for their mess up and mistakes they made !C) if as exotic a says in their reply that the. Flights were discussed at the time of booking which they were not !! Why ask for a booking reference ??? It does not make sense as why ask for it when you say we spoke to the booking agent already !!!!!Whatever happens with this trip I will not be booking my flights with Exocticca ever again ! I am sure the excursions we are about to do will be fun etc but for the mess up of the flights I can only review this based on the flights"
2025-01-10,N/A,Don't be fooled,"If you want to trip that leads you to think that you will be staying at a good location high quality hotel, don't use them!  It mostly works out that you are put in the most inconvenient low price hotel possible!  This is especially true when you pay extra for a luxury hotel option, complete waste of money!"
2025-01-10,N/A,We attempted to book a holiday with…,We attempted to book a holiday with Exoticca but found great difficulty in paying for it. We were asked to pay by bank card over the telephone and the company required our OTP number which the bank said should be shared with no-one including their bank staff. We queried it and were told it was normal procedure. We were not happy with this and as a result we didn't proceed.
2025-01-09,N/A,DONT TRUST WHAT THEYRE SELLING YOU,"Exotica refused to inform me that the rest of my travel companions had their flights changed. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was refused. They would not change my flight to match the remainder of my travel companions. For holiday goers don't book with EXOTICA, If you have any Issues they are not willing to make changes or excel at any customer serviceTHERE IS NO UNANSWERED EMAIL FROM DEC 20th. Exotica still hasn't phoned or responded to any of the online complaint form because apparently there are no managers to deal with customer complaints."
2025-03-20,N/A,"Overcharges for bad Flights, Hotels, and Transportation","Costa Rica in 10 days Review:Exoticca charges high prices for low quality flights, hotels, and transportation.  Their customer service is horrible.  Any time you call them, plan to be on hold for at least an hour.  Their WhatsApp has long wait times too, and then they say they'll do something or get back to you and they never follow through.Flights: We were put on flights with low cost airline Avianca.  The seats had the smallest amount of legroom of any airline I had ever flown.  I am very short, and my legs were cramping up by the end of the 3 hour flight.  My very tall husband hobbled off the flight.  There was no food offered on the flight -- not even a glass of water or soda.  There was no entertainment options.  We had to have a layover in El Salvador, then get on another hour+ flight.  We could barely walk when we arrived.  Avianca is the Spirit Airlines of South America.  Our return 9:35 am flight got changed to 5:05 am as our only option.Hotels: We were put in an ""alternative"" hotel in Arenal, the Eco Arenal Hotel.  This is supposed to be a Superior rated hotel, but it was NOT!  The first 2 Arenal hotels listed that Exoticca said they usually place people in were $199 and $368 per night (actual Superior rated hotels).  The Eco Arenal Hotel was only $120 per night.  We had multiple rooms in our party, so the cost difference times 3 nights times multiple rooms for the lower priced hotel was high for the lower quality hotel than what we should have received.  The hotel was probably built in the 1950s or 60s and was old and dated and deteriorating.  The 3 days we stayed there I did not get one hot shower -- the water was at best tepid and was usually cold.  Our toilet was often running constantly (maybe that was why we had no hot water?).  The little in-room Air Conditioner kept turning off every hour, and we would wake up sweating and have to turn it back on and couldn't sleep until it cooled back off.  We were admittedly tired and cranky with our poor sleep.  There was no mirror in the bathroom, so you would have to go into the bedroom to do your hair or shave.  The breakfast area was outdoors, but they did not properly cover the food to protect it from flies and insects.  They had syrup containers that were swarming with flies.  I chose a syrup container that was away from the others that looked clean, and when I poured syrup on my pancake, a dead bug poured out with the syrup!  I was so disgusted, I just handed the people my plate of food.  A majority of the people in our party got diarrhea while staying at this hotel.  Their flooring options have safety issues.  They have slick tiles at the entrance to their hotel and at the entrance to the hotel rooms.  When it rains, these get slick.  One person in our party slipped on the tile (while wearing hiking shoes), and did the splits and pulled a leg muscle.  They had to go the Emergency Room after returning to the States their leg hurt so much.  They were unsure whether they had a blood clot from all of the sitting on long flights and long bus rides (more on that later).  So they got to pay a $8,920.30 medical bill for the hotel having unsafe flooring.  In addition, the hotel has lots of curving walkways that are not very well lit at night.  A member of our party stepped off the walkway in the dark and stumbled and scraped up their hands and knees that bled through bandaids for days.  Exoticca put a married couple in twin beds in 3 out of 4 Hotels.  Even when we e-mailed them ahead of time, and sent WhatsApp messages asking them to fix it.Transportation: Transfers were supposed to be in air conditioned vehicles.  Our transfer from Arenal to Tamarindo was in a PUBLIC bus with no air conditioning, and no English speaking driver, and no waters.  The driver went around to 5 different hotels in Arenal to pick up passengers, then dropped off passengers at over 4 hotels in Tamarindo.  What should have taken 3 3/4 hours took over 7 1/2 hours, so we lost one of our vacation days in Tamarindo due to spending almost all day on a bus.  We got stuck in a traffic jam for over 2 hours without moving, and nobody knew what was happening, because the driver didn't speak English.  We were stuck there on a hot day with high humidity with no air conditioning, no water, and no way to go to the bathroom.  People were getting nauseous and sick with all the fumes because everybody had all the windows down trying to get some air flow.The Eco Arenal Hotel was NOT a superior rated Hotel, but Exoticca just gave us excuses saying that it was listed as a possible alternative and therefore we were forewarned that they could put us there.  They don't care that we overpaid for services that were not delivered.  They just hide behind their legaleze.UPDATE 3/20/25: Exoticca NEVER contacted us. Just claimed to send an email & said they assigned someone to fix it to save face. No emails. No phone calls. Never book with them!"
2025-01-02,N/A,I WANT TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM EXOTICCA ADS…,I WANT TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM EXOTICCA ADS 😡😡😡
2024-12-31,N/A,Please help!!!,"I have asked for help regarding a past trip/cancelled excursion and i have not heard from a human at all.It has been  3 weeks that i have been asking for assistance. I Have submitted several requests for help, via app, email, and telephone?????"
2024-12-31,N/A,Looks like December was a disasterious…,Looks like December was a disasterious month for Exoticca Travellers ..... so many bad experiences changed flights and hotels. So many 1 star reviews.Be warned and do not use this travel company. They fail on all levels especially customer services.And they lie.Still no adequate outcome to our complaints from mid September Balkans TourTheir concept of resolution is to offer a credit towards a future holiday. They had my money for weeks but didn’t book our flights with the explanation that they don’t book the flights when you pay for your holiday as they want to get the best price for their clients. Considering that I had paid in full I fail to see how that benefits the client who has already paid in full. They then chose a cheaper flight and say it’s the airline. I checked with the airline and my chosen flights were still available but being closer to the day now cost more. I have all the emails as evidence as do Exoticca who continue to cling to an untruth.
2024-12-30,N/A,Portugal & Morocco October 13-31,"Portugal & Morocco October 13-31, 2024 I am hopeful that my experience is not what all Exotica trips are like. The saying on our bus was ""the only way to make this trip better was to lower our expectations."" Our travel agent had other people book with this company and their experience was totally different.  Exoticca advertises that their groups are small with no more than 12-15 people.  We were aware that very rarely there could be up to 30 people on a tour.  This is exactly how Exotica advertised and sold us this trip.  While in Portugal and Morocco we were on a bus with 34 tourists. Our experience upon arrival was terrible.  Although we had booked a transfer from the airport to the hotel, we were told that the bus driver was stuck in traffic.  After a few hours, the company paid for an Uber driver to take us the 5 km to the hotel as the bus driver never did arrive. We had to wait outside in the sun until a driver arrived and of course we were the last 4 to get a ride. Had we known how close the first hotel was, we would have gladly paid a driver to take us there rather than standing and waiting for hours but no one explained this to us.Although our guides attempted to accommodate these large groups, it directly impacted our experience.  In Portugal, our guide provided us with ear pieces so we could hear her but invariably she would walk around a corner or we would get stuck in traffic on the opposite side of the road and would be unable to hear what she was saying.  In Morocco, our guide did not have the headsets and tried to use a speaker.  The speaker was useless and we were unable to hear most of the tours.  I firmly believe the guides were very good at what they did and appeared to be very knowledgeable. The bus drivers were excellent and always got us to our destinations safely.  Unfortunately, restroom stops for 34 people always took inordinately long.  Lunches would regularly take 3 hours as it was difficult for the small restaurants to feed 34 people. Consequently, we regularly didn't get into our hotels until very late forcing us to eat dinner at 8:30 or 9 pm.For the most part, the organized tours were good and we covered a lot of great locations.  Again, it was often difficult to hear what the guides were saying and I feel we missed out on a lot of the history.  In Portugal, our guide provided us with free time so we could explore the areas, or buy a coffee.  In Morocco, the tour was organized from start to finish.  I understand why Exoticca wanted to ensure that we were eating at safe establishments and thankfully none of our party became ill.  I just wish we didn't spend 3 hours of our day eating when I really wanted to see the areas we were visiting.  For the most part, the hotels were as advertised.  The Lux Fatima was definitely not up to standard. When we arrived the elevators were not operational and we had to carry our bags up many flights of stairs.  The hallway had garbage and laundry piled in it.  Several tours were staying at this location including three Exoticca buses.  Breakfast was a complete disaster because it was way too crowded so seating was not possible not to mention that the hotel ran out of food and beverages.There were some definite drawbacks for this trip and as such I have scored it a 2/5.  There were definitely some highlights such as the night in the desert and the camel ride which was amazing. We would have gladly paid more to travel with a smaller group.  If Exotica provided this guarantee then I would consider travelling with them again otherwise we will be looking elsewhere."
2024-12-24,N/A,Not a great start!,"We have not been on our holiday but I have been less than impressed with Exoticca’s handling of our outward flights to India. We were originally flying from Glasgow to Frankfurt then onwards to Delhi. However, the flights have now been changed to Glasgow to Heathrow, London to Doha and Doha to Delhi. We have a very tight turn around at Heathrow and have to get to another terminal which takes around half an hour so we are very concerned we will miss the second flight and this is making us rather anxious. We have tried  3 times and made suggestions to Exoticca re alternative flights on the outward journey but they won’t change the ones we have been allocated.Considering we didn’t approve the change of flight I feel they are being inflexible and this is causing some anxiety.Thank you for replying to my complaint. Unfortunately your facts are not correct. You emailed us on 14th Dec with a change of flight and no options were given. At no point did we agree the flight changes and we now have 2 stopovers as opposed to 1 plus a tight connection with a change of terminal at Heathrow. We would never have agreed to this."
2024-12-31,N/A,Transportation Problems in Guatemala using Exoticca,"We've used Exoticca several times and always had a very positive experience. However, we just completed a trip to Guatemala, and there were several problems with transportation. As an example, we were to be picked up at 1 PM to travel from Lake Atitlan to Guatemala City. The following day, we were to be picked up at 4 AM for a flight to Flores for a trip to Tikal. Unfortunately, we were picked up after 3 PM and then diverted to Antigua to drop off two passengers not part of our tour group (there were 12 people in our tour group). I was told the van was diverted to retrieve the additional two passengers, which accounted for the change in our departure from Lake Atitlan. The diversion to Antigua added an additional two hours (4+ in total) of travel to our hotel in Guatemala City. By the time we arrived, checked in, and prepared for our 4 AM departure the next morning, we only received around 3-4 hours of sleep. Many in our tour group were elderly; the lack of sleep was very difficult for them. Also, the tour guide abandoned our group in Antigua; he left only the driver to accompany our group to Guatemala City after dropping off the two passengers. This could have been avoided by better planning and scheduling. This was only one example of several problems with transportation. We also attempted to resolve these issues with the point of contact (Yasmin) with no positive results. Other transportation issues resulted in costing us out-of-pocket flight costs of $100. As mentioned, we have been very pleased with the agency in the past, but as a result of the above, I will be unable to recommend using the agency to anyone seeking travel to Guatemala. I am also reluctant to use the agency for travel to other locations other than Ecuador.Contact me at 210.857.3386"
2024-12-17,N/A,absolutely bad tour experience,"I hope Exoticca team will read this.I had the most regretful exp0eriece in south Africa.please contact me to explain the whole story and what happened in your bad choice tour and what items I lost because of the tour guide, that was total waste of time and money. my telephone number iws 714-862-7676.if I do not receive response I must travel to Barcelona to find and speak to your headquarters and claim my damages.thank youpamela kavehI live in California"
2024-12-17,N/A,Don’t use this company Exoticca,"Don’t use this company. It will trap you into paying hidden charges. I was forced to pay an extra £600 / $800 and told I could not cancel before hand. The actual holiday was far lower quality than advertised, despite becoming very expensive with these extra hidden costs. I would strongly advise going somewhere else.  The customer service is poor and largely an automated line that hangs up. I am now fearful of ever using any online travel agent in the future because of how bad my experience has been."
2024-12-17,N/A,Do not use this company Exoticca,Do not use this company. It is a scam. I was charged an extra £600 / $800 of hidden charges. My complaints were ignored. Despite these extra charges the holiday standard was much lower than advertised.
2024-12-16,N/A,Misleading marketing,"Misleading marketing! ""Charm"" category does not explain that hotels are 3 stars or less by North American standards.  In our case, a trip to Columbia, hotels rated 4 stars would probably be a 2 star in North America.  Nowhere is the traveller warned that communicating in the country will be difficult if they are not Spanish speakers.  Very difficult to communicate with the local travel agent when things go wrong.  Misleading information sent concerning tours. Filing a complaint is useless.  Their call centres are only there to deflect and advise that the department responsible cannot be reached by phone.  They will reply whenever they are able to review the complaint filed by email."
2024-12-16,N/A,Sacred land of the Incas tour…,"Went on Sacred land of the Incas tour in Peru. Was supposed to be 9 days, was only 8. We linked a friend’s reservation to ours to make sure we were together. Flights to Cusco were not the same. Amongst the group we travelled with we weee on 4 different flights. Transport everywhere was punctual and efficient, except for airport times. We ended up sitting at airport 3 hours earlier than domestic flight time. That is checked in through security and waiting at gate. Our flight was @ 6:00am our friends was @ 3:00pm. We were picked up at hotel @ 2am in morning. Not very restful. Hotels in Lima and Sacred Valley were very nice! We arrived in Sacred Valley prior to check in time, due to early flight. Luckily we were checked in early so we could nap. Hotels in Cusco was terrible(Hotel Mabey). Our room had blood on sheets, so noisy could only sleep with earplugs. Dirty carpet throughout hotel. Located in sketchy area quite far from downtown. Exotica was no help! Suggested we contact Condor tours. We did so and did not get a resolution. Hotel brought new sheets after an hour and we had to make our own bed. Scheduling in Machu Picchu was not the best. We received assigned seats and a few couples were seated in different parts of the train, luckily they were able to switch. We waited over half an hour in line to board the bus to get to the ruins. The tours were beautiful and guides knowledgeable. The scared valley tour was very cool but again we drove back and forth on the same roads over and over. We also visited a textile factory for the second time. This was not needed on a paid tour when we had been to one the day prior on a free tour! Lunch was great on the tour. Really enjoyed Peru and the people. Scheduling was a bit of a nightmare."
2024-12-16,N/A,Auto-booking agency with no personal touches,"Exoticca is an auto-booking agency that does not allow personal additions/changes. Pretending to be customer-orientated, the US Customer success team has no details, no knowledge, and is only good for avoiding disasters if or when they happen. Whenever anything needs to be altered or adjusted, they cannot do anything and will tell you it is up to someone else, e.g. the traveling agent they have delegated a task to in a specific country. Exact details will only be sent to you 7 days before departure, and rest assured, the hotels you saw on the initial offer, have all been changed to something in the same ""category"", just less charming.

2024-12-12,N/A,If you book with Exoticca make sure you…,"If you book with Exoticca make sure you purchase travel insurance!  Currently the only medical excuse in order to get a refund is Covid.  I’ve contacted the BBB about this erroneous policy.I booked a Switzerland trip several months back and paid in fun at that time.  Just before the trip I was admitted into the hospital for heart issues.  My doctor advised against traveling but because I didn’t have Covid and didn’t buy the insurance Exoticca denied anyRefund or credit. Now I will never afford to go on that trip again. ( 73 year old, fixed income.) I admit it was my fault for not purchasing the insurance but of course the cost makes the trip much less affordable. If you do travel with Exoticca, just be aware that if someone with a highly communicable disease is denied a refund or credit they may travel anyway to avoid losing their money.  ( think Tuberculosis,which is on the rise or other highly contagious diseases.)  GOOD LUCK!"
2024-12-11,N/A,Exoticca has no ambition to be good,"Exoticca is an auto-booking agency that does not allow personal additions/changes. Pretending to be customer-orientated, the US Customer success team has no details, no knowledge, and is only good for avoiding disasters if or when they happen. Whenever anything needs to be altered or adjusted, they cannot do anything and will tell you it is up to someone else, e.g. the traveling agent they have delegated a task to in a specific country. Exact details will only be sent to you 7 days before departure, and rest assured, the hotels you saw on the initial offer, have all been changed to something in the same ""category"", just less charming.

2024-12-10,N/A,Disappointing 11 Day Egypt Trip,"Disappointing 11 Day Egypt TripMy wife & I recently returned from the 11 day Pyramids, Nile Cruise & All-inclusive Red Sea Holiday (Booking Ref UK-EX2024244243).On our arrival we were met by a Rep from Planet Tours who run tours in Egypt on behalf of Exoticca.In Cairo we stopped at the Sonesta Tower & Casino Hotel & also the Ramses Hilton. Both are a bit dated but comfortable enough. The Nile Cruise accommodation, The Iberotel Luxor & the Amarina Abu Soma Resort in Safaga (Not Hurghada as advertised, a 45 min drive away) were excellent & we couldn’t fault them.The main reason we wanted to visit Egypt was to see the Pyramids, Sphinx & also the Valley of the Kings. Unfortunately our guide was more interested in taking us to shops to try & persuade us to  purchase goods.  During our trip we had visits to the Papyrus, Perfume/oils, Alabaster, Cotton &  Spice shops. These shopping trips took valuable time away from sightseeing, the main reason that we & our fellow travellers had booked the trip. To go all the way to Egypt & to then only spend about 1 hour at the Great Pyramid, (no other pyramids visited) 45mins at the Sphinx & about 1 hour at the Valley of the Kings was incredibly disappointing.In addition, anyone considering booking this trip should be prepared for numerous very early starts ie 3-4am. I understand that they have a schedule to run to but there was no consideration to the needs of the tourists & the only mention of an early start on the itinerary was an optional excursion to Abu Simbel. Unfortunately the early starts resulted in numerous evenings that couldn’t really be enjoyed as we had to go to bed by 8-9pm.The transport provided were good sized coaches with a toilet (not always in operation) except for our journey from Safaga to Cairo. On this occasion we had a mini-bus which was quite cramped especially with the reserve driver taking up 2 seats rather than sitting in the spare drivers seat & also the tour rep taking up two seats. We were told that the journey would take about 6 hours & that we would have to leave at 5am. As this was our last night at the Red Sea resort all the party asked if it was possible to leave a bit later so we could enjoy the evening .The Rep stated that we had to leave at that time as the police had refused to change the pick up time & tourist buses were not allowed on the road between Hurghada & Cairo at certain times. I checked with the driver of the mini-bus & he informed me that there were no restrictions on travel times between Hurghada & Cairo.The very uncomfortable journey took 9hrs 20mins, arriving at the Hilton Cairo at 2.20pm. Even then, the tour Rep was trying to sell us the idea of visiting a market, which no-one was interested in & only interested in checking into our rooms. Unfortunately there was a further delay with this, finally getting our room keys at 3.35pm.Overall we were glad that we went as the Great Pyramid & the Valley of the Kings are spectacular but we left disappointed in the tour provided by Exoticca. If you’re happy to spend the minimal amount of time at the attractions & spend your time shopping, then book with Exoticca. If not, I’d recommend using another tour operator."
2024-12-10,N/A,Departing flight departs in another province!,"Booking agent linked my booking with another and schedule me to depart in another province I don't even live in. When I called was told my only option was to cancel. Exoticcas error to have linked my booking with another patron! In what universe would I agree to fly out of another city 3 provinces away when it's not a group booking or savings for the extra days or expenses. They states in my email they linked my booking to another. Yet they swear I have agreed in that bogus reply of call audit and won't send me the transcripts.  raised concerns to noticing the wrong departure city. They wont change my flights to proper departing city, compensate me for the extra hotels and flight or  speak to a manager. Edmonton to Toronto!  What a disappointment and joke of customer service!."
2024-12-09,N/A,A seven hour journey (supposedly 100…,"A seven hour journey (supposedly 100 miles) arrived to a power cut ( that can’t be helped) suitcase soaking wet from water leaking into the luggage hold of the coach which had happened on last Thursday to someone else. Why had we not been given large plastic bags to put our cases in for protection?The room at the hotel is dirty. Excrement on the sides of the toilet bowl. Drain cover not in place so disgusting smell. No plug for the sink. Bedding very worn . Pillow smelling of stale perfume. This hotel should not be used again,After checking in we drove for a further hour to the bridge and then to the lake. The walk to the lake we were told was 600 metres but in total it was measured by a fellow traveller as 4.5 kilometres. It was going dark as we waited for the coach to return.I then had to try to dry all the wet clothing on the bathroom towel rail.So all in all not a good dayExperience on 24/09/24 written directly to Exoticca on their own “ How has your Day Been” contact App….

2024-12-07,N/A,"South Africa trip with Safari, looked good but delivery let it down","Purchased last minute a 10 day South Africa Trip, Johannesburg, Kruger and Cape town.  Seemed good price and good itinerary but encountered issues like the below:Hotel in Johannesburg was dated, rooms not ready upon arrival and bad customer service from reception.  Hotel in cape town same, extremely old and dated, carpet stained and dirty made me worry about walking bare food, received no housekeeping service and had to constantly chased amenities like water.  Also, breakfast buffet was extremely crowded all the time and the staff couldn't keep up making tables available etc.  The lodge was excellent though.Main problem was the itinerary didnt match what was delivered, transfer from Johannesburg to Kruger tool almost 10 hours but listed as 6 on the itinerary, stopping at tourist location not advertised.  Amazing Africa seems to have combined several tours together, guide was not guide but escort, didn't provide information in a timely manner and some stops were unnecessary.   When we reached out to exoticca and the operator we were given excuses but actual explanation or assurance that the return trip would be different.  I was travelling with a trapped nerve on my neck, if this information was provided accurately i would have requested private transfers!  Also, we purchased an additional safari ride but when attempted to swap to get relief from all the car transfers i was only sent policy replies by the operator amazing africa and offered no alternatives.  This showed a complete lack of flexibility which was extremely disappointing.   Finally, in cape town the hop on hop off ticket was purchased for 1 day when additional days are available at small supplements and options not provided.   But what was more infuriating was the table mountain ticket, the operator bought the cheapest option after 1pm, when an any time ticket was available with a Marginal difference in price.   Again it shows a lack of care for the customer by choosing the cheapest alternative for the operator.   All this details put a sour note on the trip. And would makeMe reconsider using exoticca ever again.  Also, their replies to customer concern are useless, they never actually answer the questions asked and just shift blame to the operators used.   As a customer i doNot care about your internal processes just solve my problem!"
2024-12-05,N/A,"Unlike my last trip with Exoticca, the Treasures of Anatolia was a great disappointment  Turkey","Unlike my last trip with Exoticca, for which I provided a 5 star review, I was very disappointed with my 12 day Treasures of Anatolia, Turkey trip.  The major issue was the quality of the tour guides.  The first day tour of the half day Anatolian Istanbul excursion, was a waste of money, as the Tour Guide pretty much ignored the group.   Since we were initially combined with a Spanish speaking group on the Bosphorus cruise, it was clear that the Spanish speaking guide provided comprehensive information, which was in sharp contrast to the English tour guide, who provided little, if any information.Upon departure from Istanbul and began our bus tour, we were provided another tour guide who continued the silent mode and made no effort to provide any information during the many long hours on the bus.  Upon boarding the bus, he usually announced we ‘could go to sleep’ and sat in the front seat either sleeping himself or playing video games on his cell phone.  The Exoticca tours are promoted as a way to better understand the country’s culture, which could be achieved by learning more from the tour guide on topics such as health care; education; the economy; politics etc.  If the tour guide offers little or no information, despite the many opportunities to do so, given the hours spent on the bus, it was indeed a lost opportunity.Lodging provided was likewise disappointing, with most of the hotels situated nowhere near a commercial district where one could venture out for meals."

That was leaking water from the celing the whole nightNever use Exotica.  They are not what they say.We recently booked a tour using Exoticca from NY to Costa Rica.  We had a horrible experience with Exoticca.   Hotels were horrible, they booked us on Avianca airline where everything was a charge including water and coffee.    The hotels were 1 star rating, but we were lied and told 4 star.   No english speaking driver, all only spoke spanish.   Do not use Exoticca"

Dollars on this trip trough exotica our trip was canceled …unfortunately we made a mistake and didn't get our visas on time, we tried to recuperate at least the flight money refund , but they give the refund to exotica, I think is unfair for us to lose all the money!

2024-11-28,N/A,schedule change,"The flight change and the option we provided will not work.  So, we requested to have Exoticca give the airline the authority to make changes and I am even willing to pay more or change the airport but nope!  Take it and no refund for air ticket either.

2024-11-28,N/A,I have put in several requests and…,"I have put in several requests and reviews about this next upcoming trip to South America and as per my experience in Greece and Turkey this agency is again giving me a difficult time. I can’t speak to a supervisor Latam won’t let me change the flights myself unless 48hours before Exoticca needs to change and they are refusing as the flight they booked was $75 and one in which we leave in the morning is $157 it is clear from flight research that your agency picked the cheapest flights.  I AM LOSING A FULL DAY IN CHILE THIS IS NOT OK! And now even if I am willing to pay for upgrade nobody will help me!!!!!I spoke to agent Stefan at latam and Camilla at Exoticca and all everyone says is “UNFORTUNATELY…..” this is ridiculousI just received another response claiming they could not change this flight as it was organized with the whole group however this is also NOT true as the flights are arranged when each person books so exactly like what happened when we travelled with them to Greece and Turkey each person travelled on a different flight to Athens from Istanbul the only thing that was the same was the date! And now they are threatening me to cancel my trip instead of accommodate even though I am willing to pay for a change in flight!!!Please be advised that they did rectify the situation. It only took 4 trust pilot reviews 2 internal emails to them on their website and a phone call for someone to get in touch with me from customer relations. As previously stated in my above review when I signed up for the trip, it was supposed to be two days in Chile. We arrived initially in Chile at 9:50 PM on January 29. We had the full day and chile on January 30 and we to leave to return to Toronto, 8:45 AM on January 31 that is a total of 34 hours . Although they have changed the trip, there was a significant cost to me $1360 Canadian dollars for three travellers and they continue to maintain that it wasn’t an error on their part Although nobody’s World is 34 hours 48 hours . On Tuesday, I was contacted by the original customer service agent Malek, who was not even the person who dealt with me. It was a gentleman name Daniel and I was asked to update this review so I have updated it with the truth. If They were truly apologetic some type of excursion and or other positive gift would have been offered."
2024-11-20,N/A,I booked the 10 day,"I booked the 10 day - 7 nights group trip to Sri Lanka. It turned out to be 8.25 days and when I queried this was told it depends on the flights. When I arrived at Colombo I found there was no group - just me!  Prior to leaving I asked 3 times how many would be in the group.  Each time I was told they didn't have that information. I was a bit concerned but my children reassured me that I would probably meet up with other travel groups.I had not had a holiday in 5 years and was really looking forward to this trip. I wanted to meet other people, I didn't want to eat alone, that was miserable. However, I carried on - my driver/guide seemed nice. On the third day, half way up Sigiriya Rock my driver collapsed and never regained consciousness, he had had a heart attack and died. No defribillator at Sigiriya which is shocking. I was very upset, luckily with the Sigiriya guide who knew whch travel agency he had been with.  I spent the next 3 hours at the police station, waiting to give a statement. I tried whatsapping Exottica from the police station and then emailed. It was a Saturday so didn't hear anything until the Monday.  In the meantime I had another driver/guide who turned out to be very informative, so I carried on as trying to arrange flights home myself seemed an impossible task. At no time was I asked if I wished to carry on with this trip. I have slept very badly since then, waking up in the middle of night and not being able to get back to sleep.  I also felt a bit responsible as if I hadn't been on my own, he may not have accompanied me.I know Exoticca are not to blame for this man's death but the fact I was put in such a vulnerable position, being on my own.  What should have been a lovely holiday turned into an ordeal.  I am 73.On the plus side Sri Lanka is beautiful and all the hotels were lovely. 7 days is not enough and I would have liked more advice.The fact is Exoticca must have known I would be on my own and did not have the decency to ask me if this would be acceptable.  It wasn't.I am still waiting for a resolution. So far a credit on another trip has been offered but my confidence with Exoticca is at rock bottom."
2024-11-20,N/A,Avoid like the Plague. Rip off,Booked a long haul 18 day holiday package through Exoticca despite previous abysmal service (I lnow!).It was not possible to see flight details from Manchester. Exoticca failed to send confirmation for over two weeks. Unbelievably we fly from Manchester to Heathrow and onward. Mo hold luggage is included on the internal or long haul flights but is included in shorter international flights. One flight has no cabin luggage.We are able to book any pay fir luggage for the international flights to and from Heathrow for £350 but not the ones to and from Manchester.It is a mess and we would not have booked if we had known if the extra cost and inconvenience.As usual Exoticca hide behind hidden terms and conditions and offer ZERO help or service. They simply blame the customer for choosing the wrong flights. I had no idea that there would be such difficulty ir expense. Exoticca claim to be travel agents and have a duty to know make clear and seek to resolve.Ignore their slick marketing and claims if massive reductions! They will put you on the cheapest flights regardless of the extra costs to you and the inconvenience.They are a rip off callous unhelpful unprofessional company. Avoid them and save money and stress. They will not help in resort if you have any difficulties as we found out.

2024-12-21,N/A,UNBELIEVABLE DISAPPOINTMENT:Our family booked a once in a life time…,"Our family booked a once in a life time family trip to Peru six months in advance. Our transfer flights from Lima to Cuzco were canceled while we were traveling in Peru. We were humiliated in the airport during checking into our flight from Lima to Cuzco. The agent informed our travel representative that our flight reservations were canceled and a refund was requested. Nope!  We had electronic boarding passes issues from the day prior directly given to us from Exotica’s representative. The embarrassment while the representative tried to verify our flight brought quite a stir, so much so another retired flight attendant from our group tried to assist. The nightmare continued on our return flight from Cuzco to Lima. We were dropped off at the airport at 9am with our group, and we were left in the airport for 8 hours waiting for our rescheduled flight at 5pm, as the rest of the group left at noon. We lost one full day of our vacation, missed our chocolate factory tour and the Inca market. We were not returned to our hotel until 9pm on the next day prior to our departure. In total lost a day and a half our vacation because a representative from  Exotica said we asked for a refund. Do people ask for a refund when they are already three days into their travel. I think not! We informed the representatives of their companies error, they could care less nor did they offer any explanation or assistance to help us. We have filed a complaint, still no response.There has been no resolve. $150 compensation does not even come close to the errors your company made by canceling our families flight and then lied about canceling our trip, stating we asked for a refund. Take responsibility for your actions! It was the airlines that changed our flights it was canceled by one of your employees!"
2024-11-09,N/A,Avoid exoiticca charging me £68 for a 3 minute transfer from the airport and won't refund me as they have told me days before about a free shuttle. Feeling conned and took advantage of already,I am due to go on a trip soon. My first experience so far of the customer service is horrendous. First of all I was told that baggage could be added by exoiticca luckily I have managed to do this myself. The phone lines keep cutting off when you try to ring customer service making it impossible to speak to anyone. Hotels are different to what the itinerary Said so I booked a private transfer been a solo traveller. However have just found out they have charged me £68 for a 3 minute journey from the airport terminal to the airport hotel. Asked for a refund as there welcome letter said use the free shuttleThey said they won't refund me and the trip hasn't even started yet after reading all these reviews I'm extremely worried and with my own experience so far. If they told me the hotel would be in the airport and a 3 minute ride with a free shuttle at the time of booking then I wouldn't have booked a private transfer so they conned me out of £68 so far. Will update my review after the trip. I will also be sharing it across my social media travel channels to give people an honest review so far it's not looking good.
2024-11-09,N/A,Mesmerising Peru,We went on a trip to Peru in Sept could not check in our luggage beforehand on both the outbound and inward flights meaning extra costs of £500 which we as pensioners cannot afford. My wife got an electric shock from the hairdryer in the hotel bathroom. The hot  spring experience was in a run down building nothing like the one you advertised. Cost was £11 eachActual cost £1. We will never use your Company again and will never recommend you to anyone else...........

2024-11-08,N/A,16 day Italy and Greece,"We paid $14,000 for our 16 day trip to Italy and Greece.  Would never use Exoticca again.  We upgraded our hotels rooms to superior and the hotels we received were 2 star at best.  95% of the hotel rooms the A/C did not work, the road noise was horrible, the beds were horrible and we either had no window or a view of the alley.  We asked to fly Lufthansa (and paid extra for this) and all flights were subcontracted out to crappy carriers.  The description of “moderate walking” was highly underrated as we did 125,000 steps in 4 days.  Thank goodness we are in shape.  I felt extremely bad for the older couples who travelled on our same route.  Our itinerary changed completely after one week and the app never updated.  We only had a paper copy given to us when we arrived at the Athens airport.  The transportation to and from trains, buses, ferries, hotels, and airports were good.  We were overly scheduled.  No sleep in times for us.  Each day we had to be up at either 5:20am or 6:30 am.  The days were very long.  We upgraded hotels and airline seat where we could (out of our own pocket- this was on top of the original $14,000).Overall, the cost was outrageous for what we received.  Never again will we use Exoticca."
2024-11-07,N/A,Beware trips offered against Foreign Office advice,"We have booked a holiday to Ecuador and Peru for December 2024. Since making our booking, the Foreign Office in the UK have issued advice that all but essential travel to the Guaya province in Ecuador is not advised as it is no longer safe. Our insurance is also invalidated if we travel against this advice. We were due to spend the last two days of our trip in this area.I contacted Exoticca to see what the situation was because of the updated travel advice. In essence they were completely uninterested in the safety of their customers saying that our only option is to cancel. No refund would be forthcoming. No alternative itinerary was offered.Surely they could rearrange part of the itinerary in this situation? We would happily pay any extra costs involved. To make matters worse they are still offering the same package to Ecuador in the full knowledge that the UK Foreign office has said it is not safe for tourism. This is not the action of an ethical or responsible travel company.I have contacted the company to complain but 8 days later am still awaiting a substantive response."
2024-11-07,N/A,Absolutely disgusting customer service…,Absolutely disgusting customer service - flights cancelled 5 days before trip and the correspondence is practically non existence.

Tours and visits didn't take place, frequent changes of hotel and actual location. Baggage soaked through, all clothes wet because of poor state of the coach used. Dirty substandard hotels with no restaurant for evening meals and no bar ( two of the eight not even local restaurants and bars in walking distance) The taxi at 4 am to take us to our return flight didn't turn up and we had to sort a local one ourselves. No compensation for our out of pocket expenses ! Their answer to give us £50 off our next holiday with them. As if we're EVER likely to use them again. I could go on .....Avoid like the plague.I notice that we were concerned about the company in August when I wrote a review ..... all our concerns were justified. They are dreadful, next step is Rip Off Britaintrying to put an update here isn't workingJUST DONT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THIS COMPANY"

2024-11-04,N/A,For anyone considering Exoticca please… Buyer Beware,"For anyone considering Exoticca please make sure to read your terms and conditions because they are not flexible even for moving your paid optional day to the beginning of your trip.  We're 7 months out from taking our trip and due to flight schedules we find ourselves needing to either cancel the optional day or move the date to the day before the trip starts.  Sounds simple, right?  Oh, you'd be shocked at how unfriendly, unprofessional and unyielding the customer support/sales people are.  The frustrating thing is that they are more than willing to add a day should you need it, but won't allow you to move the one you have.  It's not even part of the tour, but they claim that it is.  How is an extra day on our own that we paid extra for part of the tour?  Makes no sense and it has left 2 couples bewildered and upset.  Just what you want when you go on a trip and talk to other Exoticca customers."
2024-11-04,N/A,"Too much wasted time commuting, arguing and waiting…","This was a disastrous trip with them to Greece and Turkey. They subcontract all their tours who babuzzle travellers into buying extra 3x’s more expensive extra excursions otherwise you get left without transportation back to the hotels (which most are quite far away from the centre of action ie. Istanbul). The reps are inexperienced and for the most part unreachable. They were subcontractors who again combined 3 groups together 65 people on the first day - terrible sooo much wasted time we almost missed our transfer flight to Greece as there was no confirmation or pick up time sent to us! The hotels were substandard in I Stan upLa Quinta had to request multiple times cleaners and amenities - see hotel review!Long drives in Turkey to each and every location for short times at highlights, no chance to go back and always waiting in lines or for other people! Free time limited and rest time minimal except in the buses or ferries - but due to extremely large groups and extended travels times due to distances from things (hotelInto the city and between cities) leaving times were FAR TOO EARLY! In Santorini got put in a dungeon room in the basement with no naturalLight and wasn’t even hotel from original booking which we did manage to get changed to - El Greco way better than deadalus - 6 pools vs 1, weight room vs. None, unobstructed view vs. View of pharmacy in dangerous corner of street, open air restaurant va. Basement restaurant respectively! Also deadalus had awful staff rock hard beds pillows and headboards and at 5.1ft my feet were hanging over the bed (see hotelReview)! Tour company in Greece also put several groups together including air Canada vacations to maximize profits. Hotel in Athens great location but very sketchy area to the point that the concierge came running out to tell us to stick to the main road - also old outdated with small elevators and dangerous stairs - I was called to help a lady who fell down them and sprain her ankle as I am a healthcare professional, I almost fell down them myself!It should be noted I have complained twice since the trip and in multiple emails and what’s app conversations with no reply from Exoticca - once you pay they don’t care! I have been given credits but cannot use them unless I book with them again - highly unlikely! It should also be noted that I complain to the Better Business Bureau and they were told by Exoticca that he gave me these credits which one I explained to them we’re unuseable with Exoticca. You can’t even trust BBB"

2024-11-02,N/A,Travelled to Singapore and Thailand in…,"Travelled to Singapore and Thailand in Sept 2024. I have been waiting for approx 3 weeks to talk to someone about the issues we had. Complaint was filed but no one has responded. Issues included the following: one hotel only had one bed when had requested 2 beds, many issues with correspondence pertaining to pickup times for transfers, we were told that transfers were not provded in some locations but that was incorrect,  tickets not provided for excursion in  Singapore, most if not all flights  contained incorrect or missing flight               info on the app, ten phone calls had to be made during trip, over 15 Whats App texts between Exoticca and third party transfer company. (Please note that third party company apologized and refunded taxi money we incurred but Exoticca has been silent and will not get back to me about our unfortunate inconveniences on this trip.)

2024-10-30,N/A,No response to complaint of feedback,"Having already fed back and talked to Exotica on multiple occasions about our issue with flights. We have still not had a satisfactory response to our complaint. All of the bad reviews on have Exotica reply saying a customer support exec will 'reach out' to you but so far, this has not happened. All of the issues experienced seem to be around flights."
2024-10-29,N/A,Flight booking expired and left in limbo,Currently waiting to see if the flights for my forthcoming trip get reinstated as airline still have tickets and I booked this trip 9 months ago.  AIrline site  showing as booking expired and not allowing me to correct the incorrect passport number that Exoticca put in. No replies to emails and phone line still ringing after 30 minutes.  Please be careful when choosing this operator.  Maybe I have just been unlucky
2024-10-28,N/A,Absolutely disgusting don’t book with them,"Absolutely disgustingWould never book with them again.We booked a trip to Peru, Argentina and Brazil a very big trip. Where we have 7 flights throughout our trip. We are aware we have to pay for our luggage, what we are not happy about is the fact we cannot have our luggage added to any flights. We are told we can only do this at the airport, therefore we have to pay a very large extra cost due to paying for this at the airport. I think this is disgraceful! Of course we are going on a 18 day trip we are going to have luggage. We were also told it’s going to cost us a lot more on every single trip which we are not happy to pay. Our trip is now less than 30 days away and the customer service has been horrendous and not got back to us at all. This is giving me such bad anxiety and we have spent nearly £8,000 on this trip with this company and they don’t give a SH*T! Don’t use them!"
2024-10-26,N/A,Avoid Exoticca,"Avoid Exoticcawe take 12days Amazon adventure & Galapagos Discovery)- Exucador.  On this trip, we mainly went to see rare animals. As a result, we arrived in the Amazon forest and lived in a Lodge. We had no electricity for two nights and took cold showers. In amazon forest we only saw monkeys, Crickets and Spiders but spent us$85.00 for this option tours,  The accommodation in the Amazon and galagagos island was too bad. This trip is highly not recommended."
2024-10-26,N/A,Definitely would NOT recommend,"Definitely would not recommend as I have worked with several other travel agencies and this one paled in comparison. The calibre of a travel company is determined by how it responds to challenges that come up. This company fails to rise to the standards in customer service that should be an expectation when paying for their services. Most of the interactions involved emails with no signature and felt like you were interacting with computers more than humans. I had medical concerns that prevented me from flying and my dad continued on. They would not allow us to do a change fee to allow another person to go (which other agencies allow) and threatened to cancel his trip if I cancelled mine, leaving me as a no show with not a penny reimbursed.In my dad’s perspective, the trip accommodation and guide were the only positives he encountered. The flight times were atrocious and we would have saved time and money booking our own. The travel time in the country was excruciating and he felt like the whole trip existed on a bus or plane with less time exploring. I definitely would have rather re-booked with G-Adventures for this and learned a valuable lesson for the future in just sticking with the tour groups that have proven successful with an enjoyable experience."
2024-10-25,N/A,We paid for direct flights which was…,We paid for direct flights which was much more expensive. They then changed our flights to 1+stop overs and a duration 3x as long. It took hours to get in touch with someone and then we had to change the dates of our entire trip in order to get a direct flight. One of our hotels was changed 2 weeks prior and it was definitely a down grade to what we thought we were getting originally. Difficult to get straight answers from anyone and you are on hold forever. We will never be booking with Exoticca again. Save yourself time and money and book it yourself
2024-10-24,N/A,Another Review: Shady Business,"Simply Put: Do not go with Exoticca.I wrote a review on TripAdvisor with a similar message: Exoticca do not right wrongs.My fiancée and I traveled to Mexico to celebrate her 30th birthday. For the most part, Mexico was pleasant and we learned a lot about its history and culture and if you want to visit the country, I would highly recommend!However, do not do it with Exoticca, as their planning and execution will ruin your experience. Our guides did not understand travel times, nor did they uphold their end of instructions, and caused us to miss a transfer from Puebla to Oaxaca. As a result, we had no choice but to purchase additional bus tickets out-of-pocket. When finished with the full trip, we asked to be reimbursed for the travel to which Exoticca went to great lengths to gaslight us, saying it was “the customers” responsibility to follow transfer times. The reality is, our guides did not pick us up at the location and time they instructed, and considering they are responsible for our transit, to lie and tell us the mishap was on us was incredibly disheartening. All we asked for was to cover our ticket for their mistake and they insisted they lied to our faces instead.Do not use their service, they will not do the right thing."
2024-11-16,N/A,Great trips but poor aftersales service,"I have used Exoticca for 7 or 8 past trips and we have 2 future trips booked with them to Jordan and Japan. We travel abroad about 10 times a year so are experienced leisure travellers.Positive - the sales experience (both online and by phone) is very good and I like having the options on flights and excursions etc.  The trips and itineraries we have done with Exoticca have been excellent - they use local in-Country tour companies and guides that really know their stuff. I think they offer great value to amazing places.  Most of the tours are very small numbers of travellers and a few times it has just been the two of us with our own guides.Negative - the few times we have had to deal with aftersales customer service have been really bad and frustrating. The current example:On Friday I got notification that Turkish Airlines had cancelled one leg of our Jordan trip flights.A quick Google flights search showed me the remaining Turkish Flight options (from LON via IST) were awful but there was perfectly timed direct BA flights out and back with a very good price.I emailed Exoticca CS on Saturday (they are closed at weekends for calls) asking them to contact me with options and asking if we could be moved to the direct BA flights given Turkish had cancelled. I gave the full BA flight details. I agreed to pay any fare difference - noting Turkish will give a full refund because they cancelled.On Monday as they opened I phoned and asked if I could speak to someone about flight options.  I was told I could not.  I asked for a note to be added to our booking that we now wanted the direct BA option and to contact us before rebooking (the last time Turkish changed the flights, a few months ago,  Exoticca rebooked us without checking). The agent said they added a note.On Monday afternoon I got an email from a Fernanda offering me alternative indirect Turkish flights via IST with even worse timings. I replied immediately on Monday afternoon to say no thanks - please book the direct BA flights and agreed to pay any fare difference.On Tuesday I got an email from a Billy saying I can not change my flights to Japan??!!  No idea what that was about so I ignored it.On Tuesday I emailed Fernanda again - still no reply.On Wednesday I emailed CS again asking if someone was dealing with the flights.  I got a reply saying a colleague had emailed me on Monday and I needed to reply to that email (I had done so 3 times at that point!).  I replied forwarding them the emails showing I had already replied.  They replied again saying they had checked the booking and a colleague would be in touch shortly with direct flight options.As of Thursday 15.30hrs UK time still heard nothing despite chasing again........You can see my frustration sorting something that I could do myself on-line in less than 10 minutes. I just wish you could speak to someone in aftersales support who could deal with these sort of queries.UPDATE AT TUES 29th OctOn Friday they emailed me the price to change to the direct BA flights and then a payment link.  I paid and emailed them that I had paid.  But as of today they have not booked the new flights yet and have ignored chasing emails I have sent.  So I’m dropping the review to 2 stars.  The holiday is only one month away and we’re running out of time.UPDATE 14th NovThe flights I wanted were no longer available so at the end of Oct Exoticca emailed me to suggest alternative good flights that I agreed to.  They booked these for me and agreed to refund the extra flight supplement of £658 I had previously paid back to my card by the 14th Nov.  This morning (14th Nov) they had not refunded me so I emailed them to chase the refund.  However they have just charged me today again another £658 instead of refunding me!   So Exoticca now owe me a refund of 2 x £658 = £1,316.   I phoned this afternoon and got an agent who said I can't speak to anyone about this on the phone. I should email again....which I have.FINAL UPDATE 16 NovRefund all sorted.  Looking forward to our trip to Jordan soon now."
2024-10-22,N/A,Never Again with Exotica!,"Tour of Turkey+ GreeceVery large group sizes-50+;No overall Tour guide or Director or Manager-have to fend for yourself by corresponding with local travel agencies.Exotica has hired third parties to run this tour in Turkey and GreeceCoaches or bus did not have chargers or WIFILocal day tour guide in many instances did not have a mic or headsets for tourists.Very poor Planning, Organizing and Scheduling by Exotica"
2024-11-08,N/A,Avoid Exoticca,"Avoid this company. We came back from the Treasures of Anatolia Tour and it was chaotic, to say the least, from start to finish.Customer service while on the tour, none, nobody is interested. They just pass the buck to other people. The tour had to many people on it, 49 on our coach plus 3 other coaches. The coach was uncomfortable with no W/c on board for the amount of travel each day. The travel times advertised are not a reflection on what you are actually expected to do, 10-12 hours a day, be warned. Virtually NO down time whatsoever. The days were very rushed apart from when we visited an overpriced factory shop ""every day"" then time wasn't an issue.When we arrived at the hotel after transferring from the airport, we were me by the Exoticca Rep, who did not give us time to take our cases to the room before she started selling us more excursions. We felt very pressured into taking these extras as the hotels are a very long way from anything. We were also told that the dinner on the Bosphorus trip we had booked in advance for day 2 would now be on day10. This was not suitable for us as we were flying home early the next morning. So we requested a refund only to be told ""nothing to do with me. You have to get in touch with Exoticca"" In a similar vein, we booked the underground city tour in Cappadocia in advance and didn't feel well enough to attend the trip, on telling the rep about getting a refund was not interested and made no attempt to resolve this matter. There was also the issue of our party been told the trip to the Green Tomb could not go ahead because it was closed, only to find out that the other parties had been that day, LIES.After emailing Exottica on our return, twice with our concerns. We have been ignored, hence the reason for this negative review.No attempt at any compensation has been offered from Exoticca.2 weeks on still no compensation from Exoticca. Please do not book excursions in advance, as Exoticca may change the day of your excursion and you will not get your money back.5 weeks on They will continue to send you email's, 3 times a week with their offer to lure you in to book more holiday's, Beware its on their terms only."
2024-10-20,N/A,Exoticca Naples Italy ischea review,"Italy review; transfer to the Naples plaza salgar hotel was fine, check in was easy, Good location, could walk to stores and food. Went to the famous eat pray love pizza scene restaurant and saw the line and ate across the street from it. The breakfast spread was amazing with american style food (eggs and bacon etc).Amalfi coast & pompeii tour was amazing (from world tours) ally was awesome! Stopped for limoncello factory and sample. Lunch in Amalfi. Made the ferry to Ischea with 15 mins to spare. The park hotel mediterraneo is beautifully landscaped when driving in, we got there late, after dinner, but they seated our group of 9 people on the exotica tour and brought out some old food from dinner but it wasn't good (found out later that dinner is pre ordered at breakfast). I give them an a for effort though. Then given a room, 305 for us which we needed a golf cart to transport us it's so far to the back of the property. We were never given an intro to the resort or any map or any info on when the meals were. Nothing. Just here's your room. Decent size room was nice, sparse deco, no air condition (which means no fan or air movement so room smells musty and it's humid), no screens on door or window (because there are mosquitos and gnats and flies that you try to keep out of the room). Bed was comfortable even with the crack in the middle.Tasha slipped and fell entering the room on the second day coming in from the thermal pool cuz the tiles are like glass and slippery. Pool caps are required and cost 2e. Pool towels are required and cost 1.50e per day with a 10e deposit. However we saw people in the pools with baseball hats on and using the white hotel towels, so you can bring your own since no one seems to be enforcing anything. The thermal pools are nice although small for the large resort. We came in shoulder season so there was decent room but i couldn't imagine during high season.We took a taxi into forio for 20e and that was a great little day trip. The resort is on the west side not really close to anything so you have to taxi or take a tour. The bus is available for about 16 euro for a week pass.Kept the taxi drivers number from yesterday and whatsapp'd him using Google translate app to have him take us to Sant' Angelo for 25 euro each way. Def worth a few hours to stop by and if you are a beach person you can lay by the beach for under 20 euro with a chair and umbrella!Tour to Capri was fine. Super crowded, expensive and lots of people. A couple good photo opportunities but the walking tour was not worth it. We left after the 2nd stop where she showed us where JLo dances on the tables?Transfer back to Naples was a great comfy ferry with a bar and comfy chairs. The new room we got at Salgar was super nice! And it was ready early since we arrived earlier than check-in. Walking around Naples for lunch was great, beautiful weather, warm in the sun and cool on the shade. There was a 4pm 2 hour walking tour available but it was a 23 minute walk from the hotel so we decided against it. We really wanted to learn some history but 3 hours of walking was too much for us.Transfer in the morning after the hotel breakfast to the airport!"
2024-10-19,N/A,Beautiful Icelandic Adventure Ruined by Exoticca's Poor Service and Lack of Support,"The holiday organized by the local tour company in Iceland (Snæland Travel) was absolutely wonderful. However, my experience with Exoticca was truly disappointing, made worse by their lack of customer service and rudeness. They were nearly impossible to contact, and when we did, the issues were handled poorly.Our travel documents listed the wrong hotel, and only thanks to the efforts of local staff were we finally accommodated. Exoticca’s only ‘support’ was through WhatsApp, where they responded about 4 hours later, claiming it was the accommodation’s fault and that the issue had been resolved. To add to the stress, there is no phone support on weekends, leaving us in a panic when we arrived with no place to stay.We spent days trying to book hold luggage, which had to be done through Exoticca. They charged £180 for a 23kg bag both ways, but when we checked in, we discovered we didn’t have hold luggage at all. Icelandair confirmed that Exoticca’s payment had failed, but Exoticca refuses to refund us, blaming Icelandair’s website for the problem. Several other travellers on our trip faced unexpected extra charges at the airport as well. Incidentally the actual cost for hold luggage was £104Their website lacks the necessary information for proper planning. For example, many of the Reykjavik-based excursions require you to have enough time after your flight (which you can't choose) and arrange your own transportation—details that were not made clear when booking.Overall, the incredible experience in Iceland was overshadowed by Exoticca's incompetence and lack of accountability. I would recommend avoiding them if you want a stress-free trip.""UK-EX2024288358"
2024-10-19,N/A,Expect issues on Treasures of Antolia including bed bugs,"I am currently on this Turkey adventure, which I was not looking forward to in hindsight for the miles on coaches.  However, we spoke to fellow travellers who had great experiences in other parts of the world with Exoticca, so grew more excited.Firstly, the positives, let me say that our tour guide Mehmet is brilliant and can’t fault his knowledge, sense of humour and organisational skills.  You kind of warm to the tour as you gain a great expanse of knowledge and visits to various treasures.However, be warned, this trip is not for the faint hearted and if you choose it, don’t expect Exoticca to help you resolve any issues, they will try and blame their partners, which I will explain later, be warned!Our trip started with a flight cancellation by Turkish Airlines, so we were put up in Ibis Manchester overnight and put on next morning flight.  Flight great, staff friendly. Cancellation claim incoming! Now the fun begins.So I informed Exoticca that our flight was cancelled so that they could ensure that our included transfers were aware.  I also notified the local rep by WhatsApp, so I thought it fair she knew.  Later that night I get a call from some excitable Turkish man that he was here for pick up at Istanbul.  Mmmm… lack of communication I feel.  So next day flight ok arrived, we weren’t on the list for pick up, so had to wait for longer than suggested 30 mins for transfer.  Finally got to hotel……Oh dear, it look from outside very grim, but room was ok (note ok) P.S. we upgraded to superior meaning minimum 4 stars. Rep was waiting so we quickly dropped case and met downstairs in the smallest reception room of 4star hotel ever!Local Rep - the local rep was more interested in selling packages than helping out.  We had previously booked the Bosphorous River Cruise for day before but Exoticca without consultation had moved it from Purchased to Included to the next day, which meant that we would have a full day of activities from 8am until 11.30pm.  I planned the trips and extras such that we could have some relaxation space, but this wasn’t. I asked the Local Rep 3 times will we be back to have a rest and change in time because the itinerary says no! She said yes you will be back in by about 4.30ish (4 other witnesses heard same), we needed up back at 6.15pm!  Be warned timings are not accurate in itinerary, too many dependencies.  This is where it starts!WARNING! This is not a relaxing holiday or even tour!! It is full on with starts of latest 7.30am, back to hotel earliest 6pm!!! Be warned.So we decided to cancel the River Cruise that day (our fault you may say), but we never asked for this change! Then it got really interesting, our local Rep was tennis WhatsApping and accusing us of not turning up, we told various guests that we weren’t coming and to let them know, we were liars, even staring a message with “Lady….”, even though I was a man! Anyway, I contacted Exoticca about this, they after much message tennis said they would give me £30 credit for future purchases, ooh, that’s nice given the price of the tour! Don’t spend it all at once eh?I know the rooms are mostly only 1 evening, but the variations in standards are massive, from very nice to outright grim and that’s even with different travellers on the same coach!! I would say the rooms aren’t brilliant, if you’re expecting 4 star UK, not by any means, they all have faults in one way or another.  Their food choice is minimal and often Luke warm and not a lot of choice, so you will spend money eating elsewhere. If you’re vegetarian you will struggle on this tour!  But what is not to be tolerated is a hotel with potential fleas and/or bed bugs (hotel Lycus River) do not stay in this hotel!! The staff are rude and arrogant, the rooms are not nice and some have fleas or bed bugs, we witnessed them jumping on the sheets!!  dead bugs and their waste in my mattress, I refused to sleep in there and informed our tour guide, he spoke to hotel who said no other rooms available, but I had spoke to reception 10 mins earlier who said he would change our room!! Read what you will, I requested a new hotel, none available, I requested a new mattress, it’s too heavy ( you got it in there didn’t you? ) mmmm……remember, this holiday is cheap for a reason!  So I contacted Exoticca, guess what? You need to speak to our travel partner……….errrr. No, I booked through you as my travel agent!!!  Anyway, cut it short, they apparently cleaned the floor and put new sheets and cover, by the way cover is a cotton blanket that my nan used to use as an extra blanket! And it’s not big enough for later people! Where’s the quilt? We finally manage to get 5 hrs sleep.  Oh and for that Exoticca offered me £50 credit!!! what makes you think I’m going to use that?P.s. Exoticca response is rubbish, I accepted under protest, as no honour of rebooking cruise even though it was thier fault! AVOID!"
2024-10-18,N/A,Beware of sending money by bank transfer,"The holiday (Ecuador) itself was fine as this is a budget operator- Galapagos hotel was poor and flights were not seat guaranteed so I got bumped to standby on one leg, but enjoyable overall. HOWEVER, I paid Exoticca to add check in luggage to my booking, they asked for payment via bank transfer. Shortly after I paid (on 24 Sep) I was told they couldn't do it. Despite multiple calls and emails I have had excuses, been hung up on but have not got my money back. If I'd paid by credit card I'd have got an immediate refund. Don't let them persuade you to hand them money by bank transfer!"
2024-10-18,N/A,The worst  customer service representative,I haven’t even gone on my trip and I am really worried how this is going to turn out since I already booked and paid for future trip. I already  had a bad experience with customer service representative.
2024-10-16,N/A,Exoticca not honest to their customers.,"It's not even 24 hours since I booked my Escorted Eternal Cities to Italy and I'm already having an issue with Exoticca. I got an email from Exoticca customer service that the flight I originally selected for this trip (a non-stop flight to Rome) is no longer available. They have to put me in a different flight (1 stop flight going to Rome). If the flight is no longer available, then why when I check today in Exoticca website they are still selling that flight and on the airline website it is still available. Therefore, Exoticca is not honest to their customers, and they are providing false information then. I asked Exoticca to provide me a written documentation from the airline company stating, that particular flight is no longer available.I'm still waiting for their reply.Already paid 60% of the trip cost can't cancel anymore. It's very disappointing."
2024-10-15,N/A,Exoticca not honest to their customers and giving false information.,"It's not even 24 hours since I booked an Escorted Eternal City trip to Italy for April 2025 and I'm having an issue already with Exoticca. Received an email from Exoticca informing me, the flight I've originally selected is no longer available (a non-stop flight going to Rome). And they are putting me in a different flight (a flight with 1 stop going to Rome). But in their website today Exoticca is still selling that flight and in the airline website, that flight is still available. It looks like they are not honest to their customers. I asked Exoticca to give me a proof of written documentation from the airline that the flight is no longer available.Still waiting for their reply.This trip was 60% paid can't cancel anymore, very disappointing."
2024-10-15,N/A,No 24-hour change allowed for dates,"I purchased a vacation for 4 people to Italy (2 reservations) and paid over $12K in full yesterday morning. Then, about 2 hours later, my husband told me we had another trip for our anniversary booked and paid for the same week. I called right away to see if we could change the trip to 1 week before (online quoted pricing was the same). I was told because the trip is less than 2 months away and already ticketed, they could not change it without a penalty of 75% loss to cancel and re-book a week earlier. I asked for a supervisor to call me, and I would pay any flight change fee. All airlines allow at least a 24 hour cancel/re-book change. No call or email so far today for the escalation from a supervisor to make any exceptions to the rules."

2024-10-13,N/A,Treasures of Anatolia,"Treasures of AnatoliaBooking: US-EX2024239694Bottom line upfront – I would not recommend this trip to anyone I liked. If you don’t feel like reading my entire review, just know that if you do this trip, you will spend almost the entire time on a bus. You will not get to explore any of the cities where your hotels are. And you have very little choice in the food you eat.**note - we are a family of 4, paid almost $10,000 for trip, without accounting for money spent in country.All the driving. All the rest stops. When we signed up for this trip, it was not made known that the vast majority of our time would be spent in a bus driving. By the time we got to the hotels, it was late - almost every evening we arrived after 7pm, and we did not have time to explore or enjoy anything. The itinerary would say 8 hours of driving but doesn’t account for stops - ends up being 11+ hours in the bus. The most disheartening was the day it said 4 hours drive time and we were on the bus 13 hours (this includes stops of course but we left at 7am and got to the hotel at 8:15pm that day). You also have to be up very early so you have time for breakfast before leaving at 7 (or even 6am). The every 2 hour stops were at gas stations or something similar to a truck stop for 10 or 15 minutes (along with several other tour buses) and would sometimes be at locations you have to pay to use the toilet.Food. All breakfast and 6 dinners were included. Dinners were (4) hotel buffets and 2 fixed meals (salad, meat, rice, bread - no drinks included, not even water). Lunches on the road were actually worse though. We were always taken to a tourist spot with a fixed menu ($15 a person, even for children), or it had an a la cart option but had no prices listed. If it was possible to walk to another restaurant, my family did (we were the only ones) even if it meant getting an Uber back to make it in time. At the tour group restaurants, it was always the same set up and same food and you were just herded through with all the other tour groups required to eat at the same place - there are about 8-10 other tour buses that would show up at the same time making places over crowded and chaotic. Meals were always very rushed so you could  be put back on the bus as soon as possible. Funny note - one of the fixed lunches in Cappadocia was at a hotel (not the one you stay at but an isolated American chain one). I think they really didn’t want you to get out in the town.Attractions. Instead of getting to explore different cities, we were taken to a new tourist trap each day. These places were 100% only for tourist and this was evident as when you arrived, there were nothing but busses in front of them all. This included: a pottery place (all prices were considerably more than at the Grand Bazaar), a rug place, a leather store where you sat through this really long fashion show, a very expensive jewelry store, 2 outdoor shopping/photo taking places where you get badgered to buy photos you didn’t ask for printed on poor quality photo paper, and an upscale/over priced mini bazaar (seemed like a last ditch effort to get your money, especially bc our tour guide even said - this will be the best place and price to buy all your souvenirs so wait till we get there).Transfers: Our itinerary said all transfers were included but it meant just to get to the attractions- not getting back to the hotel. The first 2 days we had to get a taxi back from the Mosques. This was a 45 minute drive and cost about $25 each.Hotels - Istanbul we were very far from the city and required the aforementioned taxi ride. The hotel was fine, but nothing special for sure. This was one of the few times we had free time. Ankara hotel was better and we arrived a bit earlier so there was some time to get out and about but we were required to give our $50/pp tip that night and this took over an hour as our tour guide required us to wait in a line. I will also mention that both of these hotels had bars but drinks (for example, vodka tonic) were $17usd. Cappadocia - the hotel was about 15 minutes from the downtown area and pretty decent. You could see the balloons from here. Pamukkale was very far from the city but didn’t matter much as we got there so late - my kids did swim in the beautiful pool but that was around 9pm after another late dinner. They did have a spa there and a couple in our group was able to schedule a massage right after dinner. In Izmir we stayed at the (imo) best, most modern hotel and the only one that had USB ports to charge. It was another late, fixed menu dinner but wasn’t terrible. I think we even got free water at this one. Çanakkale was probably the worst room - the room would not get below 78° and was so tiny. Fixed menu dinner (if you skipped this, you could walk to the water while it was still daylight) and breakfast was basically different types of breads…More to say but ran out of space. You probably get the idea."
2024-10-11,N/A,Moroccan DISASTER Trip,"Day 3 - first of many times where provided itinerary description is a bit misleading. ""Panoramic tours"" of 2 cities in the same day (supposedly before lunch), when really its an extremely pass paced march with the group. ""After the tour, enjoy free time for lunch (not included)"" - itinerary description, no such thing as free time at all, simply taken as a group to a place to have lunch (1st of many such instances) where it became very obvious that we are being presented with the ""tourist priced"" menu. 3 cities in one day is far too rushed. Then again that evening, dinner provided but then get surprised that you have to pay to have any kind of beverage with the meal, not even a bottle of water included.Day 4 - ""Enjoy free time during the day to explore and have lunch (not included)."" - itinerary description, no such thing as free time at all, simply taken as a group to a place to have lunch. where it became very obvious that we are being presented with the ""tourist priced"" menu again. ""Shop for traditional crafts in the bustling souks"" - itinerary description, no real time to shop as it is a fast paced march with the group to keep to a schedule. Then again that evening, dinner provided but then get surprised that you have to pay to have any kind of beverage with the meal, not even a bottle of water included.Day 6 - ""Please note the estimated transfer time and distance of 8 hours"" - itinerary description, realistically from leaving the hotel in the morning until you get to the Berber Camp is closer to 10 hours.Day 7 - Another day where transfer time (time from leaving hotel to arriving at the next hotel) is vastly under estimated in the itinerary description. I realize the day includes stops that impact the timeline, but itinerary should describe it more according to reality. Same situations (like previous days) as far as lunch and dinner are concerned. Also being told yet again of ""mandatory tipping""....when you are told it's mandatory, that is not a tip, it is an expense. Heard these words far too often.Day 8 -  I realize the day includes stops that impact the timeline, but itinerary should describe it more according to reality. Itinerary description should probably include a note about the hike to the top of Ait Ben Haddou, in particular for some of the more elderly tourists, so they know this in advance.  ""Enjoy free time to explore and have lunch "" - another instance of a misleading itinerary description.Day 10 - ""Optional dinner at Chez Ali"" - where do I start with this. This was a paid extra, $134 CDN if you purchased this early ($150USD if you purchased it on the bus during the tour). Why the large price delta? for this kind of money, not even a drink OF ANY KIND included, that was an extra cost.. All in all, a MASSIVE waste of money. Now on to the Hotel Meriem. I have made no comments on the previous hotels, albeit the breakfasts often could have been a bit better, but they were all passable. But this hotel definitely gets a review. This hotel has a sign inside prohibiting bringing in anything from the outside, even bottled water. 2 couples on our tour had the hotel staff CONFISCATE their 2 liter bottles of water. Then the person, who I believe was the manager, but I am not 100% sure, has an absolute meltdown on one of the women in public and afterwards he strutted around like a proud peacock when he had the elderly couple thrown out of his hotel. This was by far the most extreme display I have ever seen of hotel staff in my entire life. This is all within the first hour or so of being at the hotel.Regarding the pool towels, will only be provided a towel if I purchase a drink of some kind. I got stuck in elevator with the lady from my group. This hotel should be removed from your selection of hotels.Day 11 - ""Magical Dinner in Medina with Live Show"" - This was a paid extra, $130 CDN if you purchased this early ($130USD if you purchased it on the bus during the tour). Why the large price delta??OVERALL COMMENTARY - the fact that any kind of beverage, even a simple bottle of water, is not included in any of the provided meals is unforgiveable, and if it is the norm for everywhere, then it should be in the tour description. Considering the overall fast paced schedule of this tour, any and all references to having ""free time"" should be removed from your descriptions. And as I mentioned earlier, ""mandatory tipping"" is not tipping. Your itineray description should definitely incudes some commentary that you need to have ""cash"" as most of the places we were ""taken"" to for meals did not have functional ""credit card"" utilities, this was very problematic. On more than one occasion we were told credit card machines available before the meal, only to then be told ""machines don't work"" afterwards, leaving several people to scramble to get cash together to pay for the outrageously priced lunches."
2024-10-16,N/A,I booked a holiday to Portugal,"I booked a holiday to Portugal, and 2 work days later, an email came through with a 1/2 price offer for the same package.I called for some compensation, but was refusedYet I’m sure the sales person initially must of known of the upcoming discount, yet never informed me."
2024-10-03,N/A,Misrepresentation of class of airfare,"The airline class was misrepresented. We were promised economy tickets and basic economy was booked. Since Exoticca customer service is only M-F and the tickets were booked on a Friday, we had no customer service support to resolve our issue within 24 hours as required by the airline. I cancelled the tickets for a credit and asked Exoticca to rebook tickets of the correct class using the flight credit and they cancelled our trip and kept our deposit saying it was all my fault. In short - if you are looking for a package and you'll accept what they give you, you'll be ok.  If you need any type of customer support along they way, you're left high and dry and out a lot of money."
2024-10-14,N/A,"Not enough information on website to make informed choice, difficult to communicate with a human, and the took money to book hold luggage which did not happen","The website provides you with flights (no choice) and you book the optional extra trips in addition to holiday. We were told 12 days before trip that we would have to pay at least another £400 to attend the booked trip (costing £30 each) because there was not enough time between flight arrival and trip start. In addition to extra costs this would have left us stranded with luggage. You go round in circles trying to add checked luggage to flights with no result (when you go to the airline it refers you back to Exoticca) . After 50 mins on hold we were told someone would come back with answers to questions only to be emailed exactly the same thing as above with none of our actual questions answered.Update 7 days later -we got a immediate and standard ""cut and paste"" reply  below but there was no attempt by the company to contact us. We have had to contact them on a daily basis (with lengthy time on hold), had to cancel the optional trip and still haven't had the other issues resolved (which was adding hold luggage for cold weather trip- again not an option when booking)Update 9 days later- still phoning the company on a daily basis and have now had to pay £180 to take an extra suitcase - this is a premium price because so close to the trip  but  despite this eye watering price our details still say hand luggage only. Also our optional trip which we cannot attend because the flight made not possible is still not cancelled (and i have just had an email asking if I want to cancel it despite the daily phone calls).Update at check in less than 24 hours before holiday. Exoticca took £180 but did not book the additional hold luggage. Fortunately we found out before leaving for the airport and were able to phone the airline and book this on - At £104.So far this ""holiday"" has been the most stressful and time consuming process and we have not even left. Apart from a missed call at an unsocial time for telephoning there still has been no attempt to contact us despite the platitude below and there will not be before the holiday because ""customer services"" only works Monday to Friday.1st day of holiday. Arrived at hotel only to find that there was no record of booking.  We have then anxious 2 hour wait for some sort of accommodation to be arranged and if it wasn’t for the efforts of the lady at the original hotel we would have been abandoned as the only way to contact Exoticca was an “emergency” WhatsApp which was answered hours later with “Please confirm  this is all sorted” and no concern for well being / stress / upset"
2024-10-16,N/A,Let down in Helsinki,"We are currently on a baltics with finland extension tour. First part of the tour was good. Our hotel in Helsinki is a dump, I've been trying to get to a true superior hotel for over a day and am getting the run around. Exxotica played the delay game and then when they finally acknowledged my concern have done zero...great way to ruin an otherwise good vacation. When someone books and pays for superior and gets a cheap dirty dorm room you'd think that you would do your best to ameliorate the situation ( I sent them pictures). It's not just us, the other couple on the extension are not pleased either. Great customer centricity exxotica! Follow up, they would not even cover the cost of a $50 airport transfer! Horrible organization, book with caution! As a follow up to the reply below, there was ample availability in many true 4 star hotels during this time, absolutely nothing was done. As for the transfer we were hoping at the time for a goodwill gesture. Do not try and make poor customer service look like we are unreasonable, you dropped the ball."
2024-10-02,N/A,Terrible experience and I haven't even…,"Terrible experience and I haven't even started the holiday.  Book a package holiday to Norway and get welcome email last month reminding me to pack jumpers and winter clothing. However it turns out - nowhere in the booking did it say this - that we have ZERO luggage allowance.  10kg underseat only with a bag smaller than the usual Ryanair size.Been back and forth (slow responses) to Support for last few weeks asking to get luggage allowance included.  Told to go to airline myself and pay extra, so what is the point of booking with a travel company???This morning tried ringing Support at 9.33 only to get answer phone message saying all staff gone home and open again at 9am.  Is this their way of managing the deluge of potential unhappy customers???  Ring again and phone rings off the hook.Not impressed and wondering now if I should just cancel altogether as have no confidence this is going to be the holiday I wanted and paid for."
2024-10-14,N/A,Abandoned in the middle of Turkey when too ill to move without any support,"Update 14/10/24 :No joy with Exoticca customer services investigators who claim to have helped us get back to Istanbul, but it is more ""Bull"" than Truth as we made our own way back with no help from them. Not sure what fantasy world they live in, but it's certainly not truth nor customer service.We will never travel with them again, not only for the abandonment, but for their lies and appalling attitude. When they investigate and prefer their staffs' lies to the truth, borne out with our paperwork, then what can you do?Only writing publicly on TrustPilot (five stars for Trust Pilot!) kicked them into action, they have researched their own team and found them blameless, so what's the point?Book them if you dare!! But don't be surprised when your cheap holiday becomes an expensive nightmare. We had a wonderful experience with GeoAdventure last year, bit more pricey, but well worth it.Won't touch this company again. Insurance hasn't yet paid out either, so the whole thing is a farce that could have been avoided with a bit of help.Original Review:My husband and I were left in bed with with norovirus caught on the tour bus, stranded in Cappadocia, in  the middle of Turkey with no support and no one to help us; we had to negotiate everything by ourselves; and make our own way back to the end of the tour. We asked Exoticca who organised the tour to help us join the next group who were traveling three days later. The local guide left us without any help; we had to pay 150 euros to stay an extra night in the same hotel as we couldn't get out of bed; no help from local or home organisation to get a decent price; the only contact from Exoticca was an email to offer a flight at three times the local price, sent at 3am for an 8 am flight when we were too ill to move. We missed 4 days of our tour and had to pay £800 extra for extra nights, taxi to airport, flights etc. to get back to Istanbul in time to get our scheduled flight back to Birmingham. Absolutely horrific experience. Most of the coach were ill, including the leader; who did not help in any way - even getting water and the doctor had to be done by us via the hotel who told my husband he had to go to a cashpoint while being so ill, to get cash to pay the doctor 100 euros each. Hoping our decent insurance helps - but demanding a repayment from Exoticca both for the missed tour and the shocking attitude. Every single passenger had complaints about Exoticca. Yes, its cheap - but they have legal responsibilities which they did not follow. We are following this up with the ombudsman if necessary.There were many other issues like they didn't book luggage for most passengers but don't give you your info properly to the last minute by which time you have to spend a fortune to add luggage."
2024-09-29,N/A,Do NOT! Treasures of Anatolia. Rip off,"Bottom line upfront – I would not recommend this trip to anyone I liked. If you don’t feel like reading my entire review, just know that if you do this trip, you will spend almost the entire time on a bus. You will not get to explore any of the cities where your hotels are. And you have very little choice in the food you eat. There is almost NO free time.**note - we are a family of 4 that paid almost $10,000 for this trip, without accounting for money spent in country.All the driving. All the rest stops. When we signed up for this trip, it was not made known that the vast majority of our time would be spent in a bus. By the time we got to the hotels, it was late - almost every evening we arrived after 7pm, and we did not have time to explore or enjoy anything. The itinerary would say 8 hours of driving but doesn’t account for stops - ends up being 11+ hours in the bus. The most disheartening was the day it said 4 hours drive time and we were on the bus 13 hours (this includes stops of course but we left at 7am and got to the hotel at 8:15pm that day). You also have to be up very early so you have time for breakfast before leaving at 7 (or even 6am). The every 2 hour stops were at gas stations or something similar to a truck stop for 10 or 15 minutes (along with several other tour buses). (Very detailed review on Facebook group if interest).Our last full day was the breaking point. We went to yet another tourist only shopping spot and upon entering, we were hounded by 10+ salespeople who gave you a number (so your tourguide would be rewarded for your purchases) and I just went upstairs and cried. It was so unauthentic and vulture-like. After spending the entire trip being told to ‘wait till the last day to buy souvenirs because it will be the best deals’. I assure you, you will be sorely disappointed and ripped off if you do this.A positive note, the flights were cheap."
2024-09-28,N/A,There is an internal fraud going on in…,There is an internal fraud going on in this company. Their representatives call you and ask you your card details to verify your identity . They then take unauthorised money out of your account. For older people you literally don’t know who is real or rogue representative. Steer clear and warn others.
2024-10-26,N/A,My travel partner booked our trip,"My travel partner booked our trip.  Even though she spelled my name and it was spelled back to her, it was incorrect in my details section for the booking.  Rather than changing my name spelling, they are requesting I send a photo of my passport OVER EMAIL - an insecure means. Airlines would never request this but this is their “policy.”  If they can provide a secure website, I would be willing to uplaod an image of my passport but even that is sketchy. A customer should not be required to risk the security of their personal information due to the company’s error. I don’t know of any legitimate company that would make such a request.CA-EX2024290663 I emailed a password protected file and no one had contacted me for the password.  That was 5 days ago. Is there a different way to send a password protected file other than email?Update.  I received an email asking for a password. Yesterday I emailed  the password for the document I emailed on Oct 1.  I haven’t heard back. Surely you don’t want the document and password in the same email - that would defeat the purpose of using a passwordUPDATE.  Now we are told we have to rebook in order to get the name changed. An extra $1399. Seriously??*It would have been helpful to be told this as soon as the error was reported to you.  Saving up for months and now i won’t even be able to board the plane.  ThanksPLEASE provide the flight booking numbers so I can look into this myself? Also please share the recording.  After booking, I immediately checked my details and notified the company of the misspelling.We notified Exoticca within a few hours of booking both by filling in info in the app AND via a phone call. This means that there was plenty of time (over 20 hours) for Exoticca to cancel and rebook the flights. Perhaps BBB can assist me."
2024-09-26,N/A,"The best price was $1,199.00/person with 2 left on 2/25/2025. I booked but the price became $1,424.00/person. I am not happy with that. No good.","I saw a promotion sale online yesterday 9/25 to Peru. The best price was $1,199.00/person with 2 left on 2/25/2025. I booked it for me and my wife for this tour with the sales person Emma, but asked withholding the spots for 24 hours to confirm. However, the price became $1,424.00/person when I received the email after the of conversation. I am very unsatisfied this kind deal of doing business."
2024-09-25,N/A,Great trip - poor support,"A great trip to Argentina and Brazil, but unfortunately marred by Exoticca's hands-off approach.  It is important to understand how Exoticca works - they book and pay for the elements of your trip individually, using local providers, hotels and airlines.  When it all works, it is great, but if it goes wrong, they are simply not on hand to help.  They respond to Whatsapp messages by telling you to contact the local provider - so you may as well have booked the components yourself!  They also close the Whatsapp chat as soon as they can to prevent any follow-on questions, so you need to re-do the security questions and explain the situation to another operator.In short - the perceived benefit of booking through Exoticca (a co-ordinated and supported trip) didn't come through for us - their ""Premium Care"" just doesn't exist, so we won't use them again - better to find and use the local providers directly.Before our trip, Exoticca asked to change our itinerary due to hotel availability when we were supposed to be in Rio - we agreed.  Exoticca issued a new itinerary, showing the right hotels and dates, but with the activities now on the wrong dates (Eg, our tour of Rio would happen while we were staying in Buzios), and refused to update it - so it remained wrong on the app too.When our internal flight (Buenos Aires to Iguazu) was cancelled due to a strike, Exoticca were good, and automatically found us another flight - which I was pleased about.  Unfortunately, the new airline changed the departure airport, and Exoticca didn't pick up on that, so our transfer took us to the wrong airport.  The local contact and Exoticca washed their hands of the problem, so we had to get a taxi across Buenos Aires to the right airport and could easily have missed our flight.Then our flight to Rio from Iguazu.  Exoticca put us on a flight with a 2.5 hour connection in Sao Paulo, rather than a direct flight, which left at the same time, with the same airline, so our flight took us 4 hours longer...  While at the airport, I asked Exoticca to confirm the itinerary with the Rio team because of the change to hotels etc - they simply told me that was not necessary and closed the Whatsapp chat.When we got to Rio, we were met by a rep with no English, who put us in a taxi with a driver who also didn't speak English.  We were supposed to be going to Buzios but the driver was taking us in the wrong direction (towards Copacabana).  It seems no-one had told the local team that Exoticca had switched our hotel order.  Whatsapp chat with Exoticca while in the taxi, and they just told me to contact the Rio team (and sent me a screenshot with their details).  That ended up with the local team contacting the taxi firm and asking them to park up with us for about 45 minutes while they got another driver to pick us up and transfer us to Buzios.  There was very little communication telling us what was happening.  The local contact in Rio (Journeys) apologised for the error and arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room on arrival (a nice gesture).  Exoticca sent us an email saying that it was Journeys' fault, not theirs - not a great way to handle it.On our trip we stayed in 4 hotels.  1 (La Chimere in Buzios) was excellent, 1 (Kenton Palace, Buenos Aires) was good, 1 (Nobile Copacabana) was average, and 1 (El Pueblito in Iguazu) was below average.The tours were good (or in the case of the Buenos Aires city tour, excellent)."
2024-09-25,N/A,DO NOT USE EXOTICCA TRAVEL AVOID IT ALL COSTS,"I’ve not even left for my honeymoon through this travel agency and we’ve had NOTHING but problems!We “bid” to upgrade OUR seats - that were seated together for our 6 hour flight from Detroit to Iceland. We’re told we don’t get the upgrade - fine, we call and just got more leg room - seated together with a window and middle seat - 2 days later, received an email stating ONE person was upgraded. We call Exoticca - told they can’t help and to call the airline / the airline says we can’t upgrade just one person - spend 40 min in the phone with a supervisor to to be told we’d get an answer by end of day. Only to get an email the NEXT day saying it would cost $2650!!!!! Like what the heck!?!?! That’s half the vacation costs - so again we call - and say we just want our original seats - to be told by Exoticca SORRY can’t do!!!!I’m so beyond upset and angry!This is the worst experience and we haven’t even left for our vacation"

2024-09-25,N/A,Abandoned in Jordan,"Trip had been fantastic until our return flight got cancelled.Very unhelpful and slow to respond to being contacted. I really don’t see why it is that hard to rebook flights again from Amman to the same UK departure airport. Exoticca come on get bloody organised, it’s not hard.UPDATE - Now at airport with stopover in Jeddah. Others from our tour group have been offered different flights with some still waiting for confirmation over 12 hours from contacting Exoticca. Constantly talking to different Exoticca staff and having to start our flight request from new. Talk about disorganised. I would have thought one staff member in UK or Florida would deal our party and directly with the in country contact. But no.Anyway, hopefully back in UK in about 10 hours even though to the incorrect airport."
2024-09-24,N/A,Do not book with Exoticca,"I wish I had looked at Exoticca reviews before I booked my trip.  First, every time I called them for needed help, the line was busy. Second, I asked an agent what additional fees I would incur.  They said none.  Turns out it will be about $700.  I would not have booked had I known that.  Third, their communication is very poor.  I had to ask about booking seats.  Turns out I had to look at page 13 of a document they sent me!  In this day of emails, they should have sent me an email stating what next steps were needed after I had booked my trip.Fourth, they wanted me to take down my previous review after they tried to address my questions.  No way!  Fifth, an agent told me they would be happy to take care of seat asignments and checked bag fees.  A few days later I get an email that they couldn't do that.  No explanation was given.  It was a big mistake to book with them!"
2024-09-24,N/A,They leave you stranded,"My parents had booked a tour for Sicily.  My dad ended up with an emergency in the transfer airport and was rushed to the hospital.  We couldn't get a hold of someone at the tour company, they were very unhelpful even though the situation was explained to them.  THEY WERE NO HELP AT ALL.  Finally my dad called them from the ICU unit.  Again no help.  If I could give them no stars I would definitely would.  Then they told them if they join them mid tour they would still be ok.  The next day they wanted to joint them but they told him everything has been canceled even though they were informed along the way.  They canceled all their flights, everything.They would not give him credit, they canceled all his flights even coming home.  NO SUPPORT and left stranded in a foreign country.  If you are booking with them make sure you don't have any ailments, as they offer NO SUPPORT and ABANDON you in a foreign land.  Beyond angry.  My parents are now stranded there.  I don't usually leave reviews but I think people really need to know this information to make the informed decision.  You can't get a hold of them in emergency services, they don't call you back and they abandon you.  Becareful.Reply:  US-EX2024245590"
2024-09-22,N/A,Fraud agents please avoid,"I would give this a minus star if i could as they are a scam and are a fraudulent company. My mother in law booked a holiday to china. After booking, she kept on getting phone calls from operatives from the agency asking her to verify herself by giving her card details, being elderly she obliged. They then took payments of over £3000 from her bank account. She has now had to get the fraud department at the bank involved. This agent needs to be closed down"

Call me now I’m freeUpdate to your response, I called in November 2023 when upgrading to business class, please have your facts correct before pushing the blame back on the customer.

Turns out, the insurance they include is just having the app, and being able to cancel 6+ months in advance. But no worries! The agent told us we do not need health insurance, and when I questioned that based on my research, he told me to trust him. Jason, you were 100% wrong."

2024-09-26,N/A,"Exoticca, the good, the bad and the ugly","Have now completed 4 Exoticca holidays; To be fair 2 represented excellent value for money, one pretty  good the other an utter disaster.This rating reflects that latter experience!But, to be clear, when it goes well they do offer trips that  represent great value for money.But anyone taking an Exoticca trip for the first time should do so with eyes open, hence taking time to write this review of our experience.Pre booking it's  easy to speak to 'sales' team.Post booking but pre trip it's difficult if not  impossible to talk to anybody  (long call queues) often over 60 minute wait time. Things like your actual accommodation and flight/airline  details  are notified much later than when booked and this needs constant monitoring especially of flight arrangements, timings, baggage allowances,  transfers from airport etc.When you get on your holiday you are then pretty much solely at the hands of Exoticca's in-country partner.If things are not as advertised, or go wrong you are unlikely to  get any immediate or meaningful help from Exoticca and when you do, each call, message or e-mail is dealt with by somebody different with no apparent comprehension of what has gone before. None of our  responses ever provided an actual name They all came from 'the Team' or were unsigned.Here's three examples from our recent Norway experience;On arrival our itinerary was put 'on hold' for over 6 hours while  awaiting arrival of 2 people who were on delayed flights (this is on Day 2 of our holiday). That's a party of 31 people, literally dumped in Oslo, in the rain for 4 hours and then left sitting on a bus back at the airport for another 2 hours.2.  The included excursions were all fine but if you didn't opt for them the  alternative option within our itinerary  simply didn't  materialize, that was  because the one guide on our trip opted to join the  optional (paid for) excursion and then proceeded to miss the boat booked and so departed and returned 2 hours later than scheduled.3. But easily the most concerning aspect is when something big goes wrong. In our case our return flight was cancelled.This was not Exoticca's fault, but here's where you learn why having  a good tour operator really matters.It took us a total 7 calls, 9 messages, and 5 e-mails over a stressful 7 hour period  for Exoticca to even find us a bed. In the first four hours there was no ownership of our predicament whatsoever, either in terms of offering accommodation or alternative flights.After much  pushing and prodding and some raised voices  we were ultimately told to go to three different hotels (despite the hotel we were booked into on our final night having available accommodation) only to discover the first two hotels actually did not have suitable accommodation. The second of these  involved us hauling  our luggage across the City, in the rain.When we got there it transpired only one night had been booked and nothing was available for the second night, which was useless given  our now  re-booked flights home were now via Frankfurt ie no longer direct, two days later, and getting us home at 2.00am on day 3)So would not put anybody off booking with Exoticca as there trips can be excellent value, but do so with your eyes open and be sure you are willing and able to fight, battle and argue to get them to meet there obligations when things go wrong. Do not assume those at the other end of the line have the faintest idea what has gone before, what has been done (or not) and who has been dealing with your situation.Sadly, we won't be risking a repeat of this experience and we are done with them!psAll party member were subsequently offered  £250 (per booking) for the day two debacle and were told the offer was non negotiable and compensation payments had been processed. That was well over three weeks ago, two reminders later,  and still no payment has been received.ppsSo Exoticca took the trouble of contacting me. We discussed at length our experience/ treatment following the flight cancellation. They promised to investigate and did indeed reply  with an email,  which completely ignored any reference to the flight cancellation, to the numerous calls, emails, and messages we sent trying to establish how we should get home and where we should sleep in the two days we were stranded in Oslo!Let down would be an understatement.The appearance of being concerned is an illusion, there only concern is to appear to be customer focussed.They are not!"
2024-09-16,N/A,Customer service,"We have not left on the trip yet, but so far the call center customer service has been less than helpful. Having online issues and wanting to make final payment by phone  but apparently this is not possible unless you can log into your exoticca acct …which is impossible when you are having log in issues and agents cannot transfer you to other agents 🤷‍♀️So I call back , wait in the “q” again only to be told I have to go through the travel agent that originally booked itHopefully our trip will be better than the customer service 😬"
2024-09-20,N/A,No Customer Care at Exoticca,"Thank you Trust Pilot. Without your website, I am certain my problem would not have been resolved. It is September 20, after 10 days of trying to get help from Exoticca -- no email response 4 times, on hold for a total of almost 3 hours, constant call transfers, having to speak with 6 representatives by phone, finally receiving my cancellation notice -- my problem has been resolved. If you use Exoticca, just pray that you have no difficulties that Exoticca must help you with. They do not have the will or capacity for customer care.It is September 17, 2024. Despite what Exoticca said in its reply, I have received no email. Exoticca continues to fail me as a client.Through Exoticca, I had purchased a trip to Portugal 9 day tour from Toronto, Ontario, starting October 2 to October 12. On September 6, my partner and I discovered that he has Walstrom’s Lymphoma and will have a treatment consultation on October 4. I needed to cancel the reservation.Since September 6, 2024, I have been trying to cancel the reservation. Today is September 16.Exoticca has a form to deal with trip problems. I have filled out the form; plus, sent a request to their customer service; and sent a request to another Exoticca reservation inquiry email address. I have requested help with the cancellation. I am following the instructions on their website. I have received no response. I have called Exoticca twice. They always say they have a high volume of calls. I waited 25 minutes the first time and hung . Then I waited 30 minutes the second time with no answer either time.  I have contacted Exoticca 5 times all together with no responses.Today, September 16, 2024, I was on the phone with Exoticca after another 35 minutes wait and finally got an answer. There is some problem with the phone number, so they would not let me cancel. I tried to find the phone number and asked them to wait. They hung up on me.I certainly will not use Exoticca for any future travel. The test of a travel agency is not price or how easy things are to book THE TEST IS HOW THE AGENCY HELPS A CLIENT WHO HAS A PROBLEM. EXOTICCA HAS AND IS FAILING ABYSMALLY. I have never had a travel agency treat me as poorly as Exoticca has, and I have dealt with many agencies.Exoticca has finally sent me details of my cancellation, details that I need in order to finish my application to my trip cancellation insurance. I am certain that if I had not posted my situation on Trust Pilot, a respected and well-known consumer review site, nothing would have happened. Exoticca does not care about its customers, once you have paid them the money. I strongly suggest that you choose other tour companies, ones that help clients who have problems. Exoticca takes your money and then you are all alone in the world. I have learned my lesson. I will never book through Exoticca again and I have informed all my travel friends of what happened to me. So, the most sincerest Thanks to Trustpilot."
2024-09-16,N/A,very bad trip,"very bad trip.  Buyer Beware.   Very unorganized.  Started off exoticca didnt send me the correct airport pick up info.  Gave me directions for Rome airport when i landed in Naples.  Then no driver for pickup.  My flight Was delayed, but i called Exoticca from the airport upon the delay to inform them.  Still no transfer driver in Naples.  When the driver did show up, he told us to ""wait"" while he fought with a vending machine.  ( i took a picture of this and sent to exoticca )  Also, flights were AWFUL.  a 7 hour layover to start out, with delays, turned into a 9 hour layover and cost us our first day.   Next, we arrived about 9pm the first night. No a/c in that hotel room.  Too tired to complain as it was only 1 night and we were so late, didnt take it up with hotel.   Next day, we go take the amalfi coast and Pompeii tour.   Meeting point a mile away from our hotel.  The van had no a/c.  Got sick from the heat.  No internet in the van to contact whats app for assistance.  We did Pompeii last ( very stupid planning ) and it was the hottest part of the day.   Everyone was hot on the van.  No headsets in Pompeii.  you couldnt hear the guide.  Upon return, 45 mins to collect our bags and get to the ferry.  The transfer was late.  This cost us dinner.  we get to the 2nd hotel at 9:30pm.  The room is over a 6 minute walk from front desk.  No internet.  Cant contact exoticca on whats app for assistance without internet.  Send a video the following day to exoticca showing the walk to the room.  My husband is disabled and the walk was down steps, down dark hallways, up and down a hill, and about 6 mins 30 seconds from the front desk.  The hotel KEPT OUR PASSPORTS.   contacted exoticca the following day about this.  they never answered why.   We DID manage to get our room changed out after contacting exoticca.  It was after 2 nights though. When they switched our room they handed our passports back.  was very nervous they kept our passports.  Oh, and our luggage showed up at 9:45 pm.  they had to deliver it because the hotel KNEW the room was so far we couldnt carry it.  The resturant closed at 10pm ( the only eating option that late that was close ) so by the time we made it they were closed.  They did give us a ham and cheese sandwich and cold pasta.  We had no choice in this, we did not PICK this to eat, but had to eat it because no options.  VERY bad experience.   Next bad thing was the full day tour ( extra purchase through exoticca) to Capri.   Again, no head sets.  couldnt hear the guide.  Also the guide used a sky blue flag.  Couldnt see the flag.   Some people got lost mid tour and we had to wait for them to transfer to the other side of the island for 2nd half of the tour. Next, the Naples free 2 hour walking tour didnt happen.  We did not see ANY SITES on the list.  Not even 1.  The guide said we were not on the tour list even though i brought the paperwork and voucher.  The guide was also 40 mins late.  By the time he called and they told him to take us, it was an hour past due.  He took us for a pizza and a roadside Kiosk.  This was not a food tour and we werent hungry.  Also, to meet the guide it was about a mile from Hotel.  No headsets either, but we ended up catching a cab back to the hotel because we didnt want a food tour and had to get up for airport in 12 hours.   We saw NOTHING on the list.  Then flying home, exoticca gave us a 1 hour layover in Istanbul, Turkey.  you CANT get through customs or the airport in 1 hour UNLESS your plane happens to be in the same gate area.  In Istanbul, when you land, its a 20-25 min taxi time to the gate.  So in theory, we has 30 mins to get to the gate.   Unreasonable.   We missed the flight.  Our LUGGAGE didnt even make the flight.  It was impossible.  ( to be fair our original flight was 20 mins delayed, but even so, wouldnt have made any differnce if it took off in time )  So we were stuck In Turkey, an extra day.  We had NO PLANS to be in turkey.  This cost us extra for our phone bill, and car at the airport, and food.  Just a awful tip poorly executed by exoticca.  And i have contacted them about all this, I am waiting to see if they make ANY of this right.  So far, no reply back.   If you want a VACATION, this is NOT THE TRIP to take.  It was frustrating and at times scary.   I am an extensive world traveler and i have NEVER seem more of a $hit show than this trip.I have a video of the walk to the room ( over 6 mins long)  i have screen shots of whats app conversations as well .   (when i had internet to contact them- it was so bad i had to bluetooth piggyback off someone elses phone to contact exoticca) also i have a photo of the transfer driver fighting with the vending machine at the airport.  I also have a photo of the guide showing we were not on the list for the Naples tour.  If anyone wants to see the proof of my review, i am willing to send pictures and video of the experience.Worst vacation ever.  Do NOT waste your hard earned money on this Torture"
2024-09-15,N/A,This is going to be long,"This is going to be long. I’m not very happy with Exoticca right now as they messed up my reservation. I have a 24 hold on a booking online for 2 people. The next day a friend wanted to go with the same trip but couldn’t find a roommate so I asked nice agent to hold another room for 24 hours as  a single while she tries to find a roommate. Yesterday when I was finalizing my booking, I learned that my  reservation was given away to that friend who apparently found a roommate and paid their deposit. So when I was trying to pay for my reservation, the agent told me that it’s been paid for and that was news to me since I haven’t done it yet. It turned out that Exottica changed our names to their names and gave my original reservation to them. So I was left with the booking intended for one person and I asked if my roomate could be added to the reservation since they gave away my original reservation. They said it can’t be done and I have to cancel that particular reservation and make another one to accommodate my roommate who was supposed to be in that first booking. And that if we are making a new reservation the price would not be the same since it went up yesterday. Granted it was only a couple of hundreds more but it isn’t even about the increase. It was their mistake that they gave away my reservation without even asking me, the least they could do is freeze the price.Let me make this clear, I have no complaints about the booking agents. To me they are the best part of the company, they are generally very pleasant, professional, accommodating, knowledgeable, helpful and very patient. They stay beyond their time trying to help sort out  our concerns. Shoutout to Elias, Miles and the rest. They do the best they can within the context of their job. You are an asset to the company. Thank you guys.Another issue I want to address is the policy of how to use the credits on your wallet, they have mind boggling rules for that. The most puzzling is you can’t use it to pay your balance. It can only be used in the initial phase of booking before you lit make the deposit , you have to tell the agent you want to use it. If you forget to do that and only remembered after you had paid the initial deposit, you’re out of luck, you can’t use it to pay for the balance of your account.Exoticca has already attracted a lot of customers especially here in the USA but with some improvements , it can do a lot better. I’ve seen plenty of negative reviews but I don’t usually base my decisions on  other's opinions. I give it a try myself. I have good experience with Exoticca in Morocco 2 years ago and I have booked 3 upcoming trips with them. But with this latest booking experience I’ve had with them, I probably will think twice before doing so again."
2024-09-14,N/A,not good with booking the morocco tour,No Content
2024-09-14,N/A,Can't change flight without penalty,I am traveling with a friend. We both booked the trip within a short period of time of each other but from different locations. We accidentally booked the flights leaving an hour apart from each other. We called within minutes of discovering we weren't on the same flight but was told one of us would have to cancel our trip and re-book. Plus lose our travel insurance of $200. We find this to be excessive and inconvenient.
2024-09-12,N/A,Making the Decision to Use This company.,I always read reviews.  Good and bad.  All of them.  And then look at the common theme/thread in all of them.  The two that are most common here are being able to get through to people and the location/cleanliness of hotels.  These are both very big deals.  So I will not be booking with this company.
2024-09-12,N/A,The tour price was increased by $235…,"The tour price was increased by $235 per person  during the time of initiating & completing the booking process (2-3hrs). The price was not increased on Exoticca website until 3 days later. I did not realize the increase in per person cost until payment was made at the higher price. I called the agent back & was told ""there's nothing I can do"". I have since had 3 calls to customer service & have been told that I would receive a response in ""1-3 business days"" ""early next week"", and ""cannot confirm a date"". I have been waiting almost 2 weeks for a reply."
2024-09-14,N/A,AVOID STRESS: AVOID EXOTICCA,"REF:   EX2024231003Had to cancel a trip due to health reasons.The partial refund has taken over 3 weeks to be received.So far...It feels like accounting from the 1950sI should have realised ""you get what you pay for""...with Exoticca you pay cheap and get crap service.If you want to avoid unnecessary stress...avoid Exoticca"
2024-09-11,N/A,"Disaster trip in China, Spain Team","Hello, i would like to share with you this comments, due to my frustation with this company, especially the spanish team. I will not recommend this company to anyone in my whole life. We have booked a China trip with my parents and me. First of all, the schedule was a disaster, spending so much time in places, such as Shangái or Xian. Additionally, we have contracted an insurance and other advantages since we need to change our flights for any unforeseen events. In the following setences, it is what happens after this disaster planification. My aunt has to take a surgery and we try to change the flight for other flight, since we would like to be during the surgery if something happens. Even though all the contracted package of the trip, the only solution was to spend 3.000 dollars more for OTHER flights. I think It is ridiculous as the spanish team did not make an effort to help us. Therefore, i Will share this information to my close people, in order to cancel or choose any other company instead of Exoticca."
2024-09-11,N/A,Never again,"Never againThe guide did not tell the truth about distances on the coach , we will be there in 2 hours , wrong ,3 hours and people absolutely desperate for the toilet . Google maps told us exactly how long it would take !The guide toilet-shamed a lady on the microphone to the whole coach for needing the toilet by announcing repeatedly she has a toilet emergency ,disgusting behaviour which I discussed with him at length the following morning . I also asked for a toilet break every two hours during long journeys for the rest of the week as many people on our coach are pensionersThe guide dumped us for two hours at a petrol station where the boat comes in . We ate petrol station hotdogs which were very tasty and then after two hours he made us q nowhere near the entrance for the boat and every other group got on first so we had nowhere to sit outside on a two hour boat journey in 28 degrees . There was a Viking settlement at this petrol station , I don’t think any of the 36 passengers went in as it took one and a half hours to see the displays .The views on the boat were fabulous ,and the Flam railway was just how I imagined ,just lovely , my bucket list ticked right there . HOWEVER, we arrived in Bergen 3 hours later at 930 pmWe checked in and we got our keys first so we dumped the cases and ran to the centre to beg for dinner as most resturant kitchens had closed by now at 10 pm as it’s low season . The guide had said everything is open till 11 pm , Google info on all restaurants said 10 pm is the time the kitchens closed ,so many many people on the bus did not get dinner that nightThe guide was a chatterbox repeating himself many times but some info was completely wrong such as Lindisfarne is in Scotland . There were teachers on the bus who felt as I did and their knowledge is far greater than mine.A selection of rooms ,two were like tiny shoe boxes with no room for one suitcase let alone two ,one room was fabulous looking out onto the lake with water lapping all night long , one room was 12 th floor , fab view … all these rooms were spotlessly clean and had comfy beds and clean comfy pillowsAnd one room seemed like overflow for staff I think ,in the basement with a funny over mattress on top of an old saggy mattress . This room was also very cleanThe breakfasts were just lovely for me , l like cold meats ,cheese ,herrings, salad and freshly cooked breadMy partner prefers hot food which was not really available ,even the fried eggs covered in bacon were clap cold apart from the very last morning and the bacon and sausages were hot as it was a huge busy hotel with many guests .We don’t think we would recommend this trip to friends as there were too many negatives even though Norway is truly beautiful. The two evening meals provided were absolutely delicious and plentiful ,however did not contain the advertised fish so I was disappointed tbh.On the positive side the coach was full of delightful people , thoughtful and considerate and interesting and very funny . We were totally blessed with fabulous weatherAnd we did have a laugh with many of them who were from all over the world . I have made happy memories and my grandchildren love all my pictures but my partner has flatly refused to ever go on a coach holiday again , (although he did see a moose from the coach )Date of experience: 03 September 2024"

Evrn we get confirmed from Swiss airline Ms. Sam Wleez that our return to LAX can be changed, only thing they need is from sb in your company to call them. But your rep insisted that base on your policy. I need ask who need help? Me, your loyalty customer or we need serve you? It’s really ridiculous to your rep’s attitude, and even she hang up my phone call. I think if you need get mor le business, try your very best to help your customers is always No.1 priority. Am I right?"
2024-09-10,N/A,ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. AVOID.,"Really concerned that this company is a fraud and I've parted with a huge amount of money on what is supposed to be a huge trip of a lifetime. I have tried to contact customer services repeatedly to try to book an additional activity on my holiday, but no response, just automatic reply emails. I don't trust this company and will not be surprised if I find out that this company and the holiday doesn't exist. I can't get hold of anybody to speak to. Customer service is non-existent. I would not recommend based on the fact that after booking, there's no way of contacting anyone. I'm deeply worried."
2024-09-10,N/A,No customer service,"I called many times, line never rings, pressed “call me” before checkout to call, no call not surprised because that’s how I missed the first deal because waiting for a call and then prices went up and I’ve sent email, no emails back which was shocking but not as shocking as the fact that I didn’t receive a final confirmation email after I did put down an entire payment, makes me feel like the site isn’t legit even though I know it is but hoping the actual trip is good.

I want to make a change on my passport to provide my full name and despite calling 4 times and waiting over 20 minutes twice and over 30 minutes twice I still didn't get alive person and no voice mail. I tried using their site to ammend and it wouldnot accept. Called and got through to sales and although it wasn't their job explained my predicament and got forwarded to another number which didn't work. I made two bookings with my spouse one to Porugaland another to Turkey before I realized the problem with my passport first name. Hope my trips goes smoother. A very disappointing experience."
2024-09-06,N/A,Absolute nightmare,"Absolute nightmare. Never again. We paid for 4 star hotels. They put us in a church with no fans or AC.@exoticca - I wrote what I wrote. If people are blowing $5K on vacations they deserve to know the night before their Machu Picchu hike they will not rest well and you guys will not provide good service on your only communications, WhatsApp. My vacation may be garbage but I can help others@exoticca - we asked you to move us from hotels and you did nothing.For everyone else's awareness, and I can upload photos. The rooms have no fans, no ACs and the windows do not open which is a fire and safety hazard. Exoticca has our info and can reach out when they please. I can also upload the WhatsApp chat that literally says: we apologize for the inconvenience"
2024-09-04,N/A,Very Poor Customer Service,"A group of 10 of us have booked a trip tp Italy. When booking Exoticca said it was best to book in two separate bookings for cancellation purposes. They indicated that both groups would  have the same itinerary - same trains, same hotels etc. That is not the case as the groups are in different hotels. Exoticca has been contacted many times to rectify with no resolution & just getting the run around. Have indicated they are working on it but it has been over 4 weeks & still no resolution. Have asked to talk to a supervisor & was told they do not take calls. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Very disappointed with the entire process of booking this trip with Exoticca"

We can't even upgrade on hotels or change trip date.   Wish Exoticca would allow some flexibility."
2024-09-03,N/A,not responsive to solve the issue,"I gave the travel consultant my name during the phone booking on 8/ 24 and said I don't have the passport with me, but will provide my full information including passport number a week later. When I got home a week later on 8/27, under the Exoticca request, I immediately downloaded my passport and sent to them by email. This was done before they gave me any written confirmation for my Eqypt trip on 10/13. Now 5 days later, they want me to pay over the $500 extra penalty because I spelled my middle name 1 letter wrong over the phone which is different from my passport. They claimed airline want to charge me  the extra $500. Today, I called several time and left message to my travel consultant, she never called me back. This should never happened because I did not give them the passport number over the phone, only upload the copy of my passport in the email for them to book the flight ticket when I got home. Who likes to pay the extra $500 for changing the 1middle name 1 letter. I would like to see if they could solve the issue or changing to another time for the same itinerary trip. Dissapointed!"
2024-09-03,N/A,Trip to South Africa,Trip to South Africa.  I called several months prior to our Travel date to ask if we could switch my husband to another traveler due to him being sick. We were told we could not do that and if we cancelled the trip we would lose 60 percent. Me and my 3 children went on the trip we did not receive any compensation for my husband not even his seat on the plane. During the trip our guide was more worried about the tips he would receive continually telling us about tipping him and the bus driver. We did not have enough time when we did stop during traveling. He would give up 20 to 30 minutes to be back on the bus. Then on our way to Cape Town we were stuck in the airport for over 6 hours waiting for our plane. Other people in our group were able to leave 4 hours earlier than ours. We tried to leave earlier but would have been charged a lot of money. I was extremely disappointed with this trip. I have booked several trips with exoticca and had not been disappointed until this trip. I will definitely think twice prior to booking another trip.  Unfortunately prior to this trip I already booked a trip to Thailand.

However, she neglected to apply the voucher and now your customer service people are saying it's too late because it's already booked.  I'm very disappointed with this result.  In the past, I have found Exoticca to be good at following through with its deals."
2024-08-30,N/A,This is a terrible company,"This is a terrible company. They booked our hotels far outside the locations we were visiting. The hotels were all nice when the AC was working but 2 of the three hotels did not allow you to control your own AC. Oh and if you wanted to use the pool it wasn’t included and cost an extra 15 euros. The hotel in Venice was not in Venice it was in Mestre, which means an additional 25 euros to get to Venice and another to get back. The airline tickets were basic economy and it cost an additional 75 dollars to check a bag and if you wanted to select a seat it was an additional cost depending on what was available. We spent an unplanned 800+ dollars getting seats that weren’t all middle seats in the back and we (4 of us) were still not able to sit together.I will never ever do Exoticca again. A truly terrible experience. And it cost thousands more than expected."
2024-08-30,N/A,Exoticca stops communicating as soon as you pay in full,"Exoticca is very communicative until they have all your money, then they just fade into the woodwork. No phone number, no way to check on details of my upcoming trip."
2024-08-30,N/A,Booking system is flawed,Booking system is flawed. Does not allow you to book checked bags on flight. Before I booked I was told that I could book them direct with airline once booking is finalised. Turns out Airline doesn't allow this and I have to check them in at airport at an unknown price which looks like it could be three times the price of the flights. Multiple calls to Exoticca customer service including a request to book checked bags and/or change the flight price have resulted in consistent fobbing off and impossible to speak to anybody who is empowered to do anything. Can't cancel without losing a signifcant amount of money. Suggest everybody stay clear of Exoticca.
2024-08-29,N/A,Rip off,"Right after I made a booking, the price went down $600 on the Exoticca website for the same trip. I did not even receive an email confirmation yet, so I immediately called the company but they said that they could not do anything to help me."
2024-08-28,N/A,Useless Customer Service,"I travelled to Portugal with Exoticca a month ago.Ecoticca failed to meet me at the airport at 1am, sending a helpless email instead, saying that as my flight (that Exoticca booked!) was delayed, them, who are supposed to be professional tour operator, could not get information on when my flight would land, and for logistical reasons they could not meet me. So they simply left me on my own in the middle of the night in a completely unknown city when I did not speak the language.Moreover, now, a month later, they didn't bother even to refund me the taxi fare.Terrible useless incompetent customer service.Shame!!!"

2024-08-24,N/A,"We have done many trips with exotica ,","We have done many trips with exotica ,The customer service is terrible, it is very hard to communicate with their office when you have questions, they offer cheap hotel far from city center a meals not offered and  if offered bad quality.Guides hardly speak English, I will like a company that I can communicate easily to book and service, most tours are optional and way over priced."
2024-08-25,N/A,No customer service at weekend,"No customer service at weekend. My flight/trip starts on Mon 26 Aug but there is an issue with the flight. Exoticca website provides a number to call if your trip is leaving within a couple of days so it can be prioritised. However, when you phone it says to phone back on Mon. There is no agent available to resolve the flight issue so unsure if able to join the tour on time. This is not good enough.Update - Sun 25 Aug: Exoticca’s website does not provide any mention of an emergency team or telephone line. Instead the advice is ‘If your request concerns a trip that is departing in the next few days, please contact us on +44 20 80683176 so we can prioritize your trip accordingly’. When you phone this number and select the ‘Customer Service’ option, the automated message is that this service is only available from Monday. Hence the headline for this review ‘No customer service at the weekend’. Although Customer Services have since being in communication, the advice is worrying. The flights Exoticca booked for me allow approx. 1-hour connection time during which I have to first disembark from the 1st flight and then as per the airline’s advice ‘clear customs, pick up checked baggage and recheck your bags before heading to your next gate’. This is impossible and contrary to the airlines (and standard airline industry) advice that passengers should arrive at least 3 hours before departure. As the connection time is insufficient, I will miss my connecting flights and also the start of the tour. Unreassuringly, Exoticca’s response is that 1 hour is sufficient time for connecting flight even though this is contrary to the airline’s 3-hour advice and the established 3-hour recommended arrival time within the airline industry. The problem is unresolved and I leave tomorrow morning at 6am."
2024-08-23,N/A,READ BEFORE Booking the 11 Day…,"READ BEFORE Booking the 11 Day Adventure in ITALY.There are so many misrepresentations on this tour and Exoticaa (blames the local tour company) takes no responsibility to correct the descriptions.  I paid for extra tours that never happened and they refused to refund my money.  I paid for ""superior"" category, there is absolutely no difference in accommodations and everyone stays in the same hotels and others had better rooms and bathrooms than we did.  You are essentially on your own on this tour.  There is no guide. They do not have time set aside or included for you to go into any of the basilicas, cathedrals or churches.  They also don't disclose that. They don't provide transportation in most instances. You have to manage that by yourself in a country where you don't speak the language and you assumed you were part of a guided tour.. Go with a different tour company that takes care of its travelers and doesn't mis lead them."
2024-08-23,N/A,Beware ExoticcaThe 'in country partners' who actually…,"The 'in country partners' who actually conducted the tours - havwe so far been good to excellent ... some exceptionally so.However - dealing with Exoticca itself has been a very costly, time consuming nightmare for me.They double charged me for a package to Peru - which was excellent.However, not so good that I want to pay for it 2x.They will not refund the cost of one of the trips done because of incorrect information provided to me by Exoticca staff member Dan.That trip was $3546. (and excellent value for the $ - except I paid for it twice due to an error done by Exoticca staff).I have applied to the BC Conflict Resolution Tribunal to have those funds returned to me ... and so far they have only returned a small portion.Hence I am going to proceed with the conflict resolution through the BC Conflict Resolution Panel.Unlike Intrepid - when I made an error with them - because of Exoticca staff misinformation - I explained the situation and they instantly refunded the full cost of the tour on the next credit card bill.With Exoticca - it is very piecemeal. And frustrating, and so very unnecessary.They just want me and others like me to go away while they keep our hard earned $.Even returning from Morocco ... they sent me a voucher that the hotel in Madrid would not honour.The hotel staff ... even though I had a copy of the voucher on my phone - said that it was made for the 16th of the month not the 18th.Exoticca - rather than going after that hotel ... and getting reimbursed ... refuses to reimburse me for the hotel in Madrid ($212+ Cdn $) and instead sent me a copy of the voucher that I had on my phone that the hotel in Madrid would not honour.And I had to wait hours to be picked up at the airport by the hotel service ... as they had me coming in on the 16th and not the 18th.To me - they should be getting their funds back from the hotel and not harassing me.The  return flight was a from Morocco to Vancouver was a nightmare that took the better part of 3 days ... rather than the flight that was sent to me with my itinerary - which went Morroco, London, Vancouver and took less than 1 day.To date - they will not reimburse me for the full cost of the hotel. They insist on giving me Can$ for the amount I was charged in Euros.There is quite a difference - over Can$55.For the double payment for the excellent trip to Peru ... which was the result of an Exoticca staff person giving me the wrong information ... they have reimbursed me less than 50% ... and that only after I submitted a claim into the BC Conflict Resolution Tribunal (for claims under $5000. which go into Small Claims Court).I am still in the process of getting hotel and dinner covered from the changes THEY made to my return ticket from Morocco (a fabulous tour).I love the model - that Exoticca is providing global exposure to really excellent in country tours that enable local tour companies and guides to show off their countries.I do not like that they do not meet industry standards in Canada ... and that they are so very obstructionist."
2024-08-22,N/A,Poor customer service,Update on previous review….When I booked my 2 week holiday with Exoticca I was told that the flights were hand luggage only but that adding hold luggage would be very easy to do as soon as the booking was actually confirmed.It now turns out that I cannot do this and I have complained to Exoticca and asked them to reimburse me for the significant additional cost and inconvenience of adding the luggage at the check in desk on our day of departure which is now our only option.I have asked them 3 times now to reimburse me for this cost but all they will offer is £100 off of a future holiday booked with them.I think this is unacceptable as they admit they were in the wrong and acknowledge that I booked the holiday based on false information but seemingly just don’t care.I won’t book another holiday with them - that’s for sure.
2024-08-22,N/A,I was given wrong information,I was given wrong information. I tried to book a holiday to go to turkey on there website showing flights only from Luton & stanstead . So when I rang & asked can I fly from Gatwick if that option is available the agent said yes so I called him after couple of days to book my holiday he said I am sorry flight from Gatwick is full you got to go from Luton or stanstead . So I opted out for Luton . So I asked my son if he can drop us to Luton I told him whole story he checked there is flight & seats available from Gatwick. On the same day & time clearly the agent is lying . So I requested today if I can change from Gatwick. No reason I have to travel 80 miles each way when Gatwick is only 20 miles each way . They have no shame I am 76 yrs old man . I not happy at all with the service.
2024-08-21,N/A,Terribly concerned about upcoming trip,"Terribly concerned about upcoming trip. I have travelled a lot (every year a trip) and know how tour agents can get things wrong, so I have called several times to ask questions and gather information for our upcoming trip. I realized quickly that it was up to me to contact every airline (5-6) and make sure we are sitting together (extra charge). Was told I had 2 weeks before departure to add excursions. 29 days before trip, I tried to add more excursions (the reason I decided to try this tour) and they said it was too late. I let them know it was their agent that told me 2 weeks, but they don't care. The agent even lied to me (should have got her name) and stated that an agent reaches out to us to explain it is the customers responsibility to reach out to airlines and make sure we sit together and let us know we have a time limit on excursions. That's a lie and I told her. Only once did they call, and it was to let me know I had an excursion to still pay for (thank god I added ONE to my basket before they locked it) and only emails to let me know when they change the itinerary. I have been the one contacting them to make sure I get the info I need. Still waiting on one of the airlines information (which the agent could not even find). I asked if they would email the tour company they deal with ( OR anyone that could get me in contact with someone who could help me) so they could get ahold of me and I can work it out with them. They said No and they don't know what the tour company is even named. They said tours fill up quick and Only advice, try to get a tour when I get into Ecuador. Really?!?!  So now I have to find my own tours and hope they work with Exotica's Itinerary dates (which can and does change). I also asked when I get the etickets emailed to me. They can't seem to give me an answer. They just say they will email when it gets closer. They don't really answer my questions(or give me the wrong info, like 2 weeks before departure), they just seem to tell me whatever pacifies me for the moment. I am starting to wonder about all the good reviews. Are they real? IDK. I will update this review after my trip. Hopefully I can get a tour from another company so I can still do the excursions I chose this company for. Very disappointed with customer service and Exotica as a whole. If it is this messy before I even leave the country, what is it going to be like if things go wrong in Ecuador? I already know I will have no help from this company and will have to figure it out on my own. Will never do business with Exotica again. I will update after trip."

2024-08-20,N/A,Extreme Dynamic Pricing or Bait and Switch!,"It seems they have adopted and taken dynamic pricing to an extreme.  One day we see a trip priced for $1099, three days later it jumps to $1299.. thanks to our own attempts to bring friends together. (It seems any look up, even if by the same person/ IP address counts as fresh indicator of interest, jacking up the price).If this isn't bait and switch, I don't know what would be. The only saving grace is the sales person/s. They were straightforward and told me about dynamic pricing, and also that there is little they can do.I wouldn't embarrass them. But do wonder what kind of customer service/ marketing advice the management is getting.. I can't see this as a way to build loyal customer base..No wonder I keep getting multiple e-mails from Exoticca... more emails I open and click on some itineraries, more reasons for the company to justify pricing up to others who may be seriously interested."
2024-08-20,N/A,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I booked and paid for a trip to Italy, and added a one day extension with plans to book other things - which I did on my own. When I received vouchers for activities from Exoticca, three had the wrong dates and one was missing. After three LONG calls and several emails, I was told that the vouchers (with the wrong dates) are what stood and I had an extra day so it was ok. I argued that I had already booked and paid for other activities for that extra day, but they didn't care. There was NO ONE who I could speak with: the agents state they cannot connect me with a supervisor OR the booking departments, and they do not have the answers to any of my questions. All they can do is ""escalate"" the issue which means send it back to the same department for the same outcome. So I am now unable to do everything I had planned and booked on my own. Additionally, I cannot receive a refund for this botched trip, even though I AM NOT THE ONE AT FAULT. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"

2024-08-13,N/A,Istanbul and Anatolya 12 days trip,"Everything went wrong from the beginning.1. We were not meet timely at the designated place by identified agents with the signs upon our arrival as promised.  The emergency WhatsApp numbers that they provided were not answered at the times of our numerous calls.  It took us around an hour to locate people at the contractor agency to find our way to the hotel.2.  Hotels are low in quality and most of them were old, except for Hampton Inn in Izmir.  Even though it stated 4 stars, they were more like motels, especially the one in Ankara.  There were hotels with dirty stains in bathrooms and on curtains, or hair on the bad or hair near coffeemaker.3.  The travel planning was very difficult to experience.  We had to travel 4-6 hours every day for 8 of 12 days, and two days of them were 8-hours of traveling, which turned even to a longer time because of the frequent restroom/shopping stops.  We had to stop every 1:30-2:00 hours, and provided with around an hour layover to use the restroom and buy souvenirs.  Most restrooms are horrible and dirty, some of them do not even have toilets, just the halls in the floor, many of them did not have toilet paper.  The bus was with air conditioner, but we had to frequently remind the driver to turn it on.  The bus was dirty.  The curtains on the bus had stains that seemed to be blood stains.  It was disgusting.4.  There were some interesting points of interests to see, and even more that were not shown to us.  Approximately, a half of the points of interests were just some stores and manufactures that had no significance in history or anything else, except as more likely paid some percentage of sales to the contractor agency for bringing us there.  We were just brought there to buy something and wasted a lot of our time.  Among those places are wholesalers of leather goods, rags, pots, jewelry and others.  These places were advertised as some known manufactures or historic points while in reality they were not and there were many other places like that in the area, which could be seeing while traveling by bus.  The products there were overpriced for what they were.  The organizers were just trying to brain wash tourist bringing them to places that otherwise would not make any sales.  Similar products can be bought in Istanbul twice or three times cheaper, not to mention that in the USA you can find similar products for the same or cheaper prices and better quality with known brands.5.  The first tour guide Eva or Eda in Istanbul was very knowledgeable and polite.  The tour guide of Antalya Mehmet was frequently rude, did not provide much information during the tour, and provided some misleading information that could be easily verified by the Internet.  However, he was helpful in the retrieving one item that I forgot at the previous hotel.  Without Mehmet, I would be unable to do so.  The third tour guide (English speaking) that had to guide us during the Bosphorus cruise, had disappeared during the cruise and appeared again only at the end of the cruise on our way out to say goodbye to us. We only could hear the Spanish speaking tour guide.6.  The food at the included breakfasts and dinners was mediocre.  It was so bad that last two days I could not swallow it anymore and had to visit other restaurants, which we had to pay for from our pocket.  Please note that the food in this country is mostly delicious of you go to a restaurant of your own choice.  I am not sure how the agency manage to find such a bad food for this trip.7.  The communication with Exoticca was useless.  I placed my review for every day of the travel during the travel, and even complaint to Exoticca a few times during my trip.  However, the only comments that I would receive from them were apologies and a statement that they cannot verify my information or that they chose their service contractors carefully.  There were no resolution or improvement after the review or complaint.Summary: I will never use Exoticca travel again.  My first experience with Exoticca was wonderful when I traveled to Ecuador/Galapagos a few years ago.  This is why I took two more trips with them including this one.  I do not recommend it to anyone.  Waste of money and waste of time in horrible conditions."
2024-08-13,N/A,Exoticca is a scam,"Exoticca is a scam! Beware!!!Starting from the flight, all of three seats were separated leaving from USA to London. I had to pay $300 additional for selecting seats from the layover from Boston to London which was still separated because there wasn’t enough seats left. It seems like they don’t have allocated seats for their agency but are booking the seats based on cheapest leftover availability. I was traveling with a minor child who was separated from me on the plane all the way from Virginia to London. When we got to the hotel, the location was not very desirable, cheap, and run down place in London. It was about 30min car ride to All the places we wanted to go. Then on our way to Paris via Eurostar, all our seats were separated again. One interesting thing about my assigned seat was that someone already had my seat prior to me, their seat was assigned the same number as mine but the ticket was a legit print out from the station. Basically I was a leftover standby type seating arrangement. I ended up sitting in another part of the train away from my minor child. When we got not Paris, the drive was about 50 minutes to the hotel. The Hotel was located in the ABANDONED DESERTED area where so many homeless people were living in every corner of the town. I couldn’t even stand out side the hotel front door because I feared for my life. This hotel was the only thing standing and open for business. Even the hotel looked abandoned. The hotel checked me into a two separate rooms, again separating me from my kids. What the hell kind of case is this??? The hotel said they couldn’t change to put us together because exoticca booked me this way. They’re ruining my vacation from the start to the very end. The hotel room’s phone was out of order, broken faucet, broken safe box. There aren’t any restaurants or convenient shop or anything in this area! EVERYTHING IS ABANDONED AND DESERTED!!! I felt so scared for me and my kids life. You can not go outside, unless you want to get robbed or killed. It takes 30-40 minute drive by car to get into Paris. Once we get back to the hotel, you can’t leave out of the room. What a complete waste of precious time and money. I am so heartbroken because this was my kids first European vacation. They absolutely hate Europe because of this experience. We stayed in the ghetto. I don’t know how this hotel is legally in operation. Everything surrounding this hotel is deserted with graffitis everywhere."
2024-08-12,N/A,DO NOT TRAVEL WITH EXOTICA,"DO NOT TRAVEL WITH EXOTICA, will 3rd grade service from their customer service. You will get ripped off. Ben our agent was unhelpful and wanted to keep our deposit. Gate 1 is the best company!"

2024-08-22,N/A,AVOID unless you want to ruin your holiday and risk your life!,"It was stressful, disappointing and awful experiences to say the least. We had been to Peru with Exoticca. During flight booking, there was no option to include check-in luggage for economy class on their website. We were then asked to contact the airline, however the airline told us that it was not possible to do it online as we were travelling via two different airlines (i.e., KLM and COPA) from the UK to Lima, and we needed to sort out our check-in luggages at the airport. This was really stressful as it was a lot more expensive to do so at the check-in counter at the airport.Some of the hotels are in appalling conditions and seriously lack of maintenance, which posted health and safety risks. In one of the hotels, a hot water tap broke in the bathroom when it was in use and the hot water gushed out from the tap, which caused scalding.When we complained these issues to Exoticca, they either blame the airline, the local tour agency or their customers, and they never want to bear responsibility even though they accepted our payment and sold us the tour package on their website. Indeed, our greatest mistake was to go with Exoticca.For your information, Exoticca offered a compensation of £100 for the ordeal we experienced during the trip. This is an insult to the injury and stress incurred during the trip. The compensation comes in the form of voucher for future trip with Exoticca. No way we will go with Exoticca again!"
2024-08-02,N/A,You book the trip without waiting for…,You book the trip without waiting for the passport which I said it has to be used as the sort of accuracy of the name of the passengers.
2024-08-01,N/A,Be very careful with this company,"Be very careful with this company, they are saying they are giving £3000 credit, but in fact that is not correct.I rang up and asked for an agent to explain how I could use this credit, if I bought a trip and received the credit, he said I would be able to use it against future trips from exotica.So I bought a trip to Turkey for £999, when I received the credit online I was then and only then informed I would get 1000 per year and could use it to recieve a 10% discount on future trips, which is not how it is shown online.The customer service is really difficult to get in touch with and even they had to look up the terms and conditions as they were unaware of these. In my eyes it is misinformation and I correct advertising.So I would never ever again book with this company."
2024-07-31,N/A,When I booked my trip to Turkey,"When I booked my trip to Turkey, I was assured by the agent, that I could upgrade my airline  ticket and the customer service department could do that for me.  Well, guess what, I could not and was told that they could not change the file and there was no way to change it.  I would need to call the airline, Egypt Air, which has to be the worst airline for customer service.  After many hours, I was told that I could not upgrade. I finally found one agent who would do it, but it would cost me 4000$ more! one way.  Be very wary and have all you details finalized and in writing before dealing with Exoticca.  The flights and layovers are atrocious.  I would not recommend using them.I made it very clear to the agent, that only one of us wanted to upgrade the airline ticket to business.  I asked several times and was assured that only one of us, me, could upgrade our ticket and the customer (lack of) service department could help me."

2024-07-29,N/A,Save your money,"If you are thinking of booking any trip with Exoticca, think again and run away as fast as you can.! Our friends booked a tour to South Africa for this November and asked us to go with them. We went on- line and booked the same trip, but because we were to fly out SFO, we would not arrive until a day later than our friends, who fly out of Chicago. So we ended up booked on a different tour. We called Exoticca several times, asking for our trips to be linked, and offered to re-book on a different day, and fly out of Chicago, if that made things easier. Exoticca’s answer was always the same: “Any change whatsoever to our booking would result in a 60% cancellation penalty, regardless of a re-booking.” In our case, this means we forfeit $4,200! Their stock response to these poor Trip Advisor” reviews is : “We are sorry for your experience. Please call our Customer Service Representative.” This is just a smoke screen. Their customer service representatives will just repeat that any change is a cancellation, even though it was their air routing that caused the problem."
2024-07-27,N/A,Misrepresentation,"Really angry about how the terms of my holiday were misrepresented by the sales representative.What I thought was a very helpful lady talked me through everything and advised that 1. Only 50% of the holiday was payable now with the rest due in January and 2. The booked flights were hand luggage only but that we would be able to add luggage post booking through the airline’s website or through Exoticca’s aftercare team.The day after booking I was chased for an additional 10% of the holiday cost as I hadn’t paid enough apparently. I challenged this and was told I should have paid 60% not 50% - I explained that I purely paid what I was asked to pay at the time of booking! They now seem to have accepted this.However, the flights are now confirmed and cannot be changed and I have tried to add luggage but cannot do so. So I asked the Exoticca team to do it for me and have been told it is not possible. So I am now faced with a 2 week holiday with no luggage altho Exoticca have just said turn up with your luggage on the day you leave next April and I’m sure it will be fine.This feels totally unacceptable and I only booked these specific flights because the Exoticca rep assured me that I could add luggage to the booking and that it would be cheaper than booking a more expensive flight which included luggage. I await a further response and explanation from them but I have now lost all faith in the company and am so angry. 😡😡"

2024-07-25,N/A,"Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley and Galapagos","We just got back from Machu Picchu and the Galapagos. This was a nineteen day trip. Backstory, we also used Exoticca last year for Portugal. It was amazing!! First, our hotel in Lima, Peru was an upgrade of a Hostel, not good. They also used Sky Airlines for 2 flights and this airline is horrible!! Copa was another and they are extremely rude!! The hotel in Cusco smelled of sewer. Our tour guide Morgan in the Galapagos was worthless!! Exoticca wasted their money on him!! We did have Edison in Machu Picchu and Eduardo in Guayaquil and they were amazing!! Also, we did not get to Machu Picchu until later in afternoon which they need to change to morning for more time. Now, Exoticca sent us to Guayaquil for last leg of the trip and the hotel was beautiful but 2 people were unalived 2 blocks down in front of the hospital. My husband and the friend with us are in law enforcement and also saw the paper where this was written during our walking tour. The media was in front of the hospital. Of course Eduardo lied and said we did not have anything to worry about. Exoticca should have left us in the Galapagos, back to Quito or Panama!! I have also left a review on the BBB and tried to tell Exoticca. Exoticca has not responded!!"
2024-07-25,N/A,Avoid Exoticca Travel – They Ruined Our Greek Adventure,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of booking a trip to Greece through Exoticca Travel, and I can’t stress enough how disappointing and frustrating it was. Exoticca markets itself as a convenient travel agency, but in reality, they seem to function more like a middleman, selling your booking to local travel agencies and leaving you at their mercy.While the tours we participated in were indeed fantastic, allowing us to see historic sites in Greece, the accommodation arrangements were nothing short of disastrous. Imagine staying in hotel rooms straight out of a 1960s horror movie, with no viable way to rectify the situation unless you wanted to scramble for alternative accommodations and transportation on your own – precisely the problem you are trying to avoid by using a travel agency.The most egregious issue occurred in Mykonos. Our final destination was supposed to be a hotel right on the beach, a highlight of our trip. We were looking forward to this as the grand finale of our Greek adventure. However, upon arrival, we discovered that Exoticca had moved us to a hotel two miles inland, completely removing us from the beachside experience we had been promised. This not only ruined the whole point of our stay but also forced us to spend over $100 to get to the beach on our own.When we contacted Exoticca to address the issue, their response was disheartening. They informed us that it was within their contractual rights to move us to another hotel as long as it was considered a “like hotel.” Despite this being part of their policy, they failed to acknowledge that moving us inland fundamentally altered the experience we had been promised. Their offered compensation was a $100 rebooking credit for future travel with Exoticca, which is laughable considering the circumstances.To make matters worse, it became apparent that by moving us to the inland hotel, the travel agencies involved saved $2,800. This substantial savings was obviously at our expense, making it clear that this was not an oversight but a deliberate cost-cutting measure at the cost of our vacation experience.Despite our attempts to argue that Exoticca had broken their end of the bargain by not providing us with a comparable hotel, we were met with dismissive responses. It was clear that once they had your money, they had no real incentive to ensure your satisfaction.The whole purpose of visiting Mykonos is to enjoy its famous beaches, and Exoticca’s failure to deliver on this crucial aspect of our trip left us feeling completely let down. It was a disappointing end to what could have been a memorable vacation.In conclusion, if you value your travel experiences and want to ensure your trip goes as planned, I strongly advise you to avoid Exoticca Travel. Their business model might seem appealing at first, but their lack of accountability and disregard for customer satisfaction will leave you regretting your choice. Save yourself the trouble and book directly with reliable travel services or agencies."

2024-07-26,N/A,"Beware, Purchased a package to Italy","Purchased a package to Italy, next morning prices dropped $200/person for the exact same options. Called and was greeted with sorry not our problem. Buyer beware.I find it strange that you can match a competitor before purchase regardless of your cost but after a package is purchased we are left with just buyers remorse. Why come to you if a competitor offers for cheaper? I will search more next time and not fall for lame excuses."
2024-07-25,N/A,Beware,"Beware, price guarantee is a joke. Prices change daily, don’t buy on a high day. For if the price goes down a minute after your purchase there is no adjustment. Makes me want to buy another tour, NOT!"
2024-07-26,N/A,Terrible Customer Service and Tour Guide,"Highlights of things that went wrong:  When I booked the trip, I assumed there weren't any direct flights to Lisbon since I had a layover.  When asked about it, the rep said I didn't ask for a direct flight and I would have to cancel the entire trip, lose money and rebook to get a direct flight.  She also could care less since the trip was already booked.  The best flight options should have been offered from the very beginning.  Our tour guide (Beatrice) had an attitude with the group and was very unfriendly. We also were not given enough time in places and always felt rushed.  She made the trip unpleasant from the start.  A tour guide is a big part of the trip can make it more memorable.  The driver did not allow anyone to use the bathroom on the bus.  On our last day back in Lisbon, we waited on a very long line to check in just to find out that our rooms were not reserved.  We had to be put in another hotel which was a pain after a very long day and hours on a bus.  This happen to a few of us on the trip.  I will never use Exoticca again.  I have used Gate 1 Travel in the past and they were completely on top of everything and made our trip a great experience.  I enjoyed my alone time with my family, but the experience with this company was extremely disappointing.  If you want top-notch service, don't use this company.Booking Reference:  US-EX2024239030"
2024-07-23,N/A,I’m not pleased at all,I’m not pleased at all. I called customer service to resolved an issue with my recent trip and I can not get any response nor converse with a supervisor. Unprofessional!No one reached out to me regarding this matter.
2024-07-22,N/A,I booked a trip to Norway last night…,"I booked a trip to Norway last night and was told that a sale was ending, so time was of the essence. This morning the exact same trip is $600 less. As I saw this huge price difference less than 24 hours after booking the trip, I called Exoticca. The agent agreed the trip is now much less expensive, but said I could not get a refund in the price or credit of any sort once the trip is booked. There is a Best Price Guarantee on their website. She refused to honor this. Very poor customer service. ."
2024-07-22,N/A,God Awful… everything from the booking…,God Awful… everything from the booking process to customer service leading up to the trip. Your itinerary isn’t final until 2 weeks prior giving them the ability to switch everything. They trick you every step of the way. The upgrade option is a joke but if you don’t pick it you’ll end up regretting it even more since they separate you into groups but really you are together when transporting. The ones in basic and the ones in premium all arrive together. Jordan is a hostile environment with extreme dry heat and impoverished cities. Petra is 4 miles in 4 miles back out. They beat the animals. Nothing like their royal family and IG pics. Egypt although a little less scorching due to the river is beyond discussing. The ships- if you can call them that were last upgraded in the 80’s and you are basically on a barge infused with petroleum smell.  The food let’s just say I wasn’t sure if the meat was 🐪 or 🐕
2024-07-22,N/A,Less than stellar experience,"Among other things that were less than stellar with Exoticca on our trip to Turkey, we paid for a full tour but we only got half since our tour was shared with a non-english speaking group so more than half the time we were together the commentary was in a different language! Exoticca responded to this complaint saying that it is their practice to co-mingle groups (even with a group that doesn't speak your language) if the group that speaks your language is too small. In order to avoid that you have to book a private tour! Please note: we were not told of this at the time of booking so we feel bamboozled!"
2024-07-22,N/A,Processing delays of refund,Processing delays of refund. Supposed to get a refund in June but so far didn’t get it. Agents were no help at all. Poor service.
2024-07-22,N/A,You took long to respond and didn’t…,"You took long to respond and didn’t refund my money after that when you were not responding to weeks of my calls because you were busy. You should have refunded my deposit because  I was calling you and since it was the first time that I was using you I thought you were a scam when you didn’t respond to my calls. You called me in your own sweet time and refused to refund me. I don’t  know if  I would use you ever. I cancelled because of your inefficiency so I do g think it was my fault since I was nervous that I was going to end up with no place. If I waited longer. There should be exceptions to your cancellation policy as there are exceptions to any time. I didn’t just cancel because I changed my mind, you were not responding for weeks, it was stressful to think I was going to end up with no vacation. Stressful to call you day and night because I was not sure if it was a time difference issue. I went to a lot of stress before deciding to cancel. Then you treat this as if it was my fault I should have paid “insurance” in case I cancelled.  After  what I went through trying to reach you with calls and emails  because I had pressure from who I was tracking with, they shred to know what was going on, you might as well have been a scam. For me, you didn’t deliver and if I remember how you made me feel, it’s a zero for me. You ended up with my money when you did nothing for me and it wasn’t my fault, exceptions to any rule, you were in the wrong. If it was you trying someone  for the first time and they disappear, ghost you,  what would you have thought in today’s world?"
2024-07-21,N/A,This Company feel like Scammers,Having been charged an extra £100  per flight as the price changed during the booking process I was not happy.  Since then I have received an email asking me to check passenger information.  My wifes name and mine have been intermingled.  The booking was made using the correct passenger information within the Exotica system.  Having pointed out the error they want another £148 to make a name change which I dispute is my fault.  I know my wifes name and it is not Richard.  I feel like I am being scammed.
2024-07-20,N/A,Check your baggage allowance,"I recently realized my international trip did not have a checked bag included, I don't remember being asked if I didn't want a checked bag. The others I'm travelling with all have checked bags included. Further to this the Exoticca app says I have a carry on, the airline says I do not. Exoticca responded to my first email asking if I wanted a checked bag quote and saying the app is correct. I replied with info from the airline. It's been 10 days and Exoticca has not responded and nothing has changed with the airline. Not sure how I'm supposed to go on a week tour with only a purse.Exoticca did send me an email asking for a review. So far not off to a great start."

2024-07-19,N/A,"I will tell them that you never get what you wanted, that is not guarantee's on accommodations.","Hi.  To start with this review I have to said that the accommodations were low grafted. We are a husband and wife, and four hotels gave us two single beds!!! We upgraded the accommodations to supreme to get good hotels and service.  The rips were shorted every time by half or one hour. One of the city tour guide y could understand what she was saying. I believe her name was Julia!!  Carmen was a very nice lady. She should be the one giving the bus and city tours.  The time that we get out of the bus to go see the plaza de toros was half an hour.  When there is to many people in the bus we need it more time. Not 15/20/25 min.  Over all I  give you three (3) star ⭐️ out of five.   Your people needs improvement. The restaurant also needs improvement."
2024-07-19,N/A,Inept customer service,We have paid twice for our luggage and raised a complaint which nobody seems to wish to resolve.I have contacted your ‘ help line’ whom were unable to actually help.I have asked your customer care team to contact me and resolve and they have not.I have spent over £25.000 with Exoticca on 2 holidays over the last 2 years.Do you wish to retain my business?
2024-07-18,N/A,Disappointed.,"Checking in at Barcelo San Jose, our room was not ready we  were told it will be ready in 10 mins, so we decided to check the hotel out and have something to eat. We get to the front desk, the room is ready but no towels, someone will bring the towels in 10 mins, an hour later no towels so call front desk sending them up right away, 1/2 hour later no towels called again same answer, finally I walked out in the hallway and picked up 2 towels from the cart.Hotel Eco Arenal.The room was so basic it had a bed, one side cabinet, no chairs, no cabinets to hang and store your clothes, all it had were shelfs. the bathroom had no amenities all it had was shower gel and that too was empty it was filled upon request, the towels were old and worn. The safe was in the bathroom. There was a coffee maker in the room, we were told that we had to purchase the coffee from the front desk, no water bottles this to had to be purchased. The breakfast was basic.All 3 hotels we stayed are classed as 4 star on the website, Barcelo and Wyndham agree on the rating However Eco Arenal is no were near a 4 star.The drive from Arenal to Tamarindo was over 6 hours and from Tamarindo to San Jose the same. We lost almost 2 days in travel time.Does anyone from Exotica time to time check the itineraries they are selling to make sure that what is being offered is what they signed up for with the hotels and the local agents.Overall not a great experience. Will not use exotica again"
2024-07-18,N/A,Not the greatest trip,"This particular trip was packed with too many cities and not enough time to explore them. No one expected spend majority of trip travelling on a bus and not having enough time to tour the beautiful Spain. The are huge distances between each city, so you end up sitting on the bus with a very few bathroom breaks for majority of days. We were forced limit our water intakes since we travelled 2-3 hour without a bathroom break..."
2024-07-18,N/A,Bad experience,"I made the first payment for my trip as you requested but my friend who was going to travel with me, cancelled the trip for work issues.  You did not allow me to go solo on my trip with the additional payment needed.  Instead, you took my money.  You refused to give me a credit or refund my deposit.  That to me is stealing."
2024-07-18,N/A,Too fast pace for spending majority of…,Too fast pace for spending majority of time in bus. Shopping in a supermarket for lunch and dinner shop not have been part of the experience. Just include Oslo to Bergan they were the only necessary part of the trip.
2024-07-30,N/A,The Sales people lie to you to get the…,"The Sales people lie to you’re to get the booking. Then once you have booked and paid they have no interest. I am dreading this holiday because this company has been awful just at the booking stage.Well below you can see they are just words. They said sorry but a dedicated agent would reach out to discuss my situation. Well 4 days later no dedicated agent has reached out. Customer Service doesnt exist with this company.No dedicated agent has been in discussion. I get emails with no names on them, hiding behind anonymity. There is no one being helpful it is just trying to justify your lies, in fact compounding the lies. No attempt to solve the issue has been made 6 days later. The issue here is the Sales Agent lied about aspects of the trip to get the booking, this became apparent once I paid and confirmation was sent. Its clear now you have the money there is no interest in your giving any customer service. Even you trying to tell the world a dedicated agent ( how would I know there is no name on the mails ) would enter discussion ( is that speaking ? )with me is a lie, well after 6 days it hasnt happened.Lies and more lies. Sorry for confusion ? The agent lied to me about the flight details in order to get the booking. I have requested a copy of the audio from you, please post back here to let the readers of this review know you have sent it.Should I add its the information I wasnt given which is the issue here. Even though this information was known."
2024-07-18,N/A,Extremely difficult to contact a customer service representative.,"Extremely difficult to get through to a customer service representative. The waiting time is interminable!We needed to cancel due to health issues. We were promised a partial refund in April, but now it is mid-July and we still haven’t received it, in spite of my calls to follow up."
2024-07-18,N/A,Could never get ahold of a real person…,Could never get ahold of a real person to speak with but the company had no problem with taking our deposit and keeping it when we needed to cancel for medical reasons.  Would never recommend your company to anyone. We really wanted to see Peru but will not be using your travel company.
2024-07-18,N/A,Very poor response to request for information,"I contacted the telephone number to enquire about my booking, especially regarding the booking of flights which doersn't seem to have happened since I paid a large deposit. I was assured I would get and email reply but to date nobody has contaceted me with an update. This is very disconcerting after paying a large deposit!"

2024-07-18,N/A,I am so frustrated,"I am so frustrated. We live in reno. We booked a trip to Greece with Exoticca. Our flights go from Sacramento to Denver and then to Europe. I called to ask if we could fly reno to Denver instead. No flexibility even though it is two months away. So, we will have to drive to sac, leave a car, and rent  a room. Does this even make sense??"
2024-07-18,N/A,Horrible wait times,"I waited 30 minutes or more on the phone to speak to someone! The alternative was to send a text that would be answered in 3 business days?!Do better, Exoticca"
2024-07-18,N/A,"Exoticca Fraud, Morose Tour Guide and Jello for Desert?","Trip to Norway-Once I paid for the trip, Exoticca refused to answer any  questions . I emailed Exoticca about Norse Air requirements, as air fair was included  and Norse refused to answer so I ended up paying over $300 for luggage and my small handbag. That should have been explained. I emailed Exoticca for an itinerary and list of hotels, nothing, so I called and waited 60 minutes to talk to someone . I received information on hotels  but later received a list of totally different hotels mostly in the outskirts of these towns with nowhere to have dinner.Meals- two meals were included and the first meal, I wouldn't feed to farm animals. Desert was jello, shameful, we paid thousands for this tour and you feed adults Jello? Second meal was very nice.Tour Guide-It was an all English speaking tour yet we had a woman from Madrid whose english was not up to an English tour (confusing us on several occasions ) whose topics included her cremation, serial killers, her cremation, dying in the frozen areas of Norway and the problem with burying dead people, her cremation and most appalling, her patronizing talk explaining to Americans who Martin Luther King, Jr. was. (Remember, we are in Norway.) When a group behind me decided to look out at the beautiful fjords and block out the diatribe on Norwegian serial killers, she became angry and barked at us over her microphone to listen to her.During her final remarks as the tour ended she reminded us to live well as we would all die.  ( I couldn't make this up!)After 4 hours of touring on a tram and boat ride one day several of us requested a short stop in Flam before we boarded the bus for a 2 hour ride to the hotel to buy some drinks, she refused saying that Exoticca would not pay the driver past 6:00 pm and we had to rush to the hotel.  Exoticca probably made close to  $100,000 for this full tour bus but they can't pay a driver past 6:00 pm . ( Other days, the driver worked past 6:00 pm so this was not true.)The driver was excellent and I learned more from him about Norway then the tour guide .The sights were beautiful and there were wonderful excursions but the lack of communications, hotels in the middle of nowhere and hostile, patronizing tour guide  made us feel a bit scammed."

And also you had our passport saved on your data base.I really don’t know where W came from. Again, I told you guys we would sue you if you don’t make correction for my wife’s last name!!!We booked many trips with you guys, and this time we booked a Switchboard trip and agent put my wife’s last name wrong. When we send requests asking for making change. The reps were rediculously requested us to pay more than $300 for their mistake(we put our passport info years ago, but they claimed we load passport info late after booking.

But, I continued to receive notifications to pay the balance, and I replied each time I had cancelled already. Now I am told that it’s too late to cancel and I lost my $456. I’m very upset. I’m not interested in this company any longer, though I had booked trips with them in the past and enjoyed them. I was not informed, by the initial male agent,  that I would lose my credit money. No one listened, when I tried to cancel."

I rebooked a tour asking for a simple modification to my flights and, despite other companies I've worked with who have been happy to make these types of modifications, your company would not entertain any modifications even when I'm willing to pay any price changes. Add'l, I was so confident your company would have no problem making these modifications AZ have other companies, I booked the tour. Now I find out no modifications are possible and I will lose 60% if I cancel. Of course, I am now reluctantly forced to stay on this tour and will make my own arrangements to insure I can modify what I do regardless of what your company will do as it will be cheaper to do that than cancel. So...I am happy to finally use the money in my voucher with ur company and no have to deal with you again in the future."

One week later civil unrest broke out in Ecuador and we chose to go Portugal instead.  You refused to let us switch our trip to Portugal and we were not going to an unsafe country for vacation.  We ended up booking our own trip and you kept our $1000 deposit. You are a horrible company and I tell all my friends and family to NEVER do business with you.  No morals, no integrity."
2024-07-17,N/A,Unsympathetic and inflexible.,The company was very unsympathetic when I had to cancel just 48 hours after booking. No option to change trip and I lost £500 deposit. An expensive mistake booking with Exoticca.
2024-07-24,N/A,Look elsewhere for a travel company,"My entire experience with Exoticca has been terrible. They are very eager to take your money, but once they receive your payment, everything you would expect goes out the window. I had to cancel a trip and I am only taking an upcoming trip because they are so difficult to get a refund for (which you don’t get in currency unless you pay several hundred dollars extra). Also, there’s really no guarantee about your flights, so that can change and you may get a basic economy fare with no seat selection options.Things like details really aren’t important once you pay for your trip. For example, I have a trip booked in 40 days and have not received any details about what hotels I will stay in or really any logistics. How can you plan things if you don’t have the details? I will not use this company again.UPDATE: Exoticca did reach out in response to my review and I now have my travel info one month before my trip. This booking experience has been challenging to say the least.  Now I’m going to try and put the experience behind me and enjoy my trip."
2024-07-17,N/A,Way too expensive for what you get. They just book through other companies. I would recommend booking through those companies directly.,"There were multiple situations where our group had different internal flights from each other, flights were cancelled and exotica did nothing. The only good thing about the tour were the guides which do not even work directly for exotica."

2024-07-16,N/A,Red flag: not able to pay with visa card without calling in,"I need to pay with  a Visa travel benefit card as many travelers have these. I was forced to call in to pay a remaining balance as they only allow a bank transfer method online. I am not sure if they are passing on to the customer the percentage savings by this bank transfer method either. They need to offer both methods online, and inform customers of any bank transfer method savings.Update to the response from exoticca. Sorry, but what part of without calling in don't you understand. I have  an account and desperately tried to pay  with Visa online. Your payment method defaults to pay by bank transfer, and I was forced to call in twice. Please allow customers to pay online by visa without having to call in to be given a link to be able to pay by visa. Your call center acknowledged that I must call in to be given a link to pay by visa."

2024-07-12,N/A,"Not what expected, a disappointment.","We recently came back from Peru,  a tour we bought through and arranged by Exoticca Travel. Could not have been more disappointed. I will mention just a few of the failures. The individual tours offered by Condor where good and sometimes excellent, but the service provided by Exoticca Travel was a failure. All they did was arrange the transportation and hotels. We felt stranded most of the time. What was provided by this agency you could easily arrange on your own. No personal service, a different bus to every destination, use of Peru public transport to every destination, not a chartered bus. Three people on our group almost lost their connection from Cusco to Peru because Exoticca had not paid or finalize the transaction with the airline. And as it happened constantly during our trip, except when in a tour of course, the only communication available was through AI chat. Eventually, we could reach the central offices in Spain. We communicated with costumer service, explained on detail all the problems we experienced and all they did was to respond with a letter full of excuses and a $70 dollar credit for a future tour. Needless to say, a credit we will not use. Later on, they sent us a survey. Of course we completed it , again with all the details. Still waiting on a response. On our opinion, and that of the other 12 guests, travelling with us, Exoticca Travel did not provided what advertised. We would not recommend it."
2024-07-12,N/A,Buyer Beware,"This was my 3rd trip with Exoticca (Costa Rica in 10 days) and it was such a disappointment compared to previous trips.The highlights - good mix of locations to experience different areas of the country. Transportation was very well coordinated between sites and guides were great.Where things went south… What is described in the itinerary is not always what you experience. It noted the package included economy flights, yet basic economy fair was purchased.2 of 3 hotels fell short of mtg basic expectations. The hotel in La Fortuna was one of the backup hotels and by far the worst. No screens in the windows meant a room full of bugs, soap dispenser was empty and the breakfast was questionable with food sitting out without any covers to keep the bugs away. Tamarindo hotel was better, but there was no hot water so it was a frigid shower every day. I discussed with the front desk and was told there was no hot water so nothing they could do. All 3 hotels required an Uber ride to get into town.The optional excursions didn’t reflect what was advertised at purchase - one excursion described a completely different location and company than the one we were taken to. Given it was not what I had purchased, I reached out to customer service asking for a refund and was denied. Instead I was offered a small credit for a future trip. So disappointed in the customer service."

After two weeks of contacting them, they dealt with the problem but to be honest it was not the result I was expecting. Now I can't see my itinerary in the app. After logging out, uninstalling it and then installing again and still can't see it. As I said I haven't started my trip and already I am fearing what is the next thing they are going to do wrong. I am travelling to China for the first time. I will for sure tell about my experience travelling with Exoticca. Fingers crossed, we didn't have a good start with the booking, I hope the trip goes well.🤞🤞"
2024-07-06,N/A,Türkiye 10 day Anatolia tour,"Türkiye 10 day Anatolia tourWe were exited to travel with the reasonable offer and interesting Itinerary.Exottica had an app that included all our trip information, hotels, included and optional purchased excursions, flights etc BUT failed to advise us of the implications of the holiday occurring during this time and many points of interest being closed with no alternative itinerary. Exottica subcontracted with a Turkish tour company, the communication was very poor right from the onset. Exottica had changed our flights but the tour company had something different they would not listen, we were only able to secure transport as someone else recognized our phone number as an Alberta, Canada number and intervened on our behalf, otherwise we would have been waiting several hours for transport. We found that  multiple emails and text messages to both Exottica and the tour company went unanswered. We were literally not given any help or support when we got sick.  For example my husband was quite ill when we arrived in Cappadocia, we told our tour guide we could not eat the predetermined lunch spot as my husband was very sick. We said we wanted to get a cab to our hotel. We were told no we had to wait outside in the 42 degree Celsius heat until everyone else ate their lunch. When we arrived at the hotel he made us wait until everyone else had their room key before he allowed us ours. I was absolutely shocked at the rude and in sensitive response.NOT GOODRight from the start we found issues. The food was very very poor quality, no options but to eat it.  I will attach the lunch photo that was the “special lunch” at the “best seafood restaurant in Istanbul”, it was cold and inevitable while our tour guide was provided a hot deep fried fish with sauce.The buses did not have bathrooms, stops were at disgusting crowded truck stops, and had very poor air conditioning. All drinks were an added cost ($5 CAN or ₺ 100 for a small bottle of water) no drinks were included with meals that we had paid for. NOTE: by drinks I mean a soda, water or juice. Tour company never provided any water despite 42 degree weather, the tour guide had no interest in Our feedback, I believed he was getting kick backs from places visited with high pressure to purchase items. He was aggressive and rude to female travellers. He left the tour several times to go visit family or friends. He claimed the $50 USA per person collected by him was not enough tip that we should be tipping more.High pressure to purchase additional excursions  with threats you will only get a ride back to your hotel if you buy an extra excursion. Our hotel was at least half hour cab ride from the hub of activity at times up to 1.5 hours and $150 CAN one way.  We would be left on your own to find transportation. Hotel location very isolated so you could not leave the hotel or purchase food or beverages anywhere else.We purchased an additional tour to ensure we had transportation and the “special lunch” for $100 US BUT then found out the primary site was closed.We witnessed and my husband intervened when very aggressive driver was trying to take two of our female tour mates to another airport and refused to give them their luggage. We also witnessed people on our tour who were targeted for sales and felt they had no choice but to spend hundred if not thousands of dollars on scam merchandise. It is a very congested, everywhere with traffic jams and long lines.  I understand this country is hoping to attracting tourists with cheaper holidays but I would say was very misrepresented. Not just because we both got sick (food poisoning and heat exhaustion on day 3, that I still haven’t recovered from) but because I felt the entire trip was a scam. I was glad we decided 6 days in to leave the tour and make our own arrangements at our own additional cost. I would never recommend that anyone book this tour or travel to this country.Booking numberCA-EX2024253327"
2024-07-05,N/A,First experience with Exoticca booking,First experience with Exoticca booking.  Company was not so flexible with making changes to reservations although I had just booked it 48 hours.  I wanted to change one of the passenger.  They sited that making a change would significantly change their service & fee structure.  Not sure how swapping person A for person B would impact them.  I was even willing to pay any airline fees.
2024-07-04,N/A,Poor Associate Response,"I spoke directly with Oliver about my trip to Peru. I wanted to fly via American, since all my status is on American. He told me he would send my request to travel and get back to me the following day. I called the next day asking for him which he told me to do. I was told he would call me back in 10 min. I never received the expected call. I don’t consider this to be professional behavior. If you cannot accommodate my request, just say so. Therefore without hearing from him as promised I booked myself."
2024-07-04,N/A,NON RESPONSIVE MOST OF THE TIME,"A lack of timely communications, or no follow-up at all, continues to plague Exoticca.  This includes wait times of 60 minutes when calling and email responses that are system generated and never result in a follow-up from an Exoticca staff member.  Recent promotions have exacerbated this situation.  Perhaps the one exception are pre-booking sales communications.Our experience with post sales/pre-trip inquiries and support were also often not answered, or so inadequate they were useless, which in my opinion, makes Exoticca poor choice for unexperienced travelers.Emails received during a trip are scripted and generic promising future improvements.So, while Exoticca trip itineraries and prices are competitive, there is a very high level of frustration when choosing Exoticca as your trip provider."
2024-07-04,N/A,"Wrong flights, wrong nationality.",We paid extra for specific flights and were booked on the wrong ones - even the departure date was incorrect. Our nationality on the personal information list was also not correct.
2024-07-03,N/A,Well made the reservation on the 11th…,"Well made the reservation on the 11th of June  pay in full with American Express, you say never received payment, is July 3th, now just wander what happen .. I gave you all information Of American Express, Screen shot etc,, still could find the money .. this is a mistery.."
2024-07-03,N/A,STAY AWAY!!,"STAY AWAY!!! BEWARE OF BAD TRAVEL AGENCIES!!!   EXOTICAA Online Tour Operator was HORRIBLE! Travelling Sometimes you read bad reviews in a mix of good reviews and think, maybe it’s a one-off.  NOT THE CASE!!  I question if the good reviews are authentic now.   My review is almost identical to some of the bad reviews that I had previously read, but assumed the same thing couldn’t possibly happen to us.  I was wrong.   To summarize, this travel agency:  Books mediocre tours, using local tour guides who are outsourced.  Exoticca then make a profit by booking you (in our case incorrectly) on the absolute cheapest flight from your city to your destination.  These flights often include tight connections (beyond those recommended by airlines), using inconvenient routes, on cheap airlines and providing zero support when something goes wrong.  Instead, they’ve already locked in your fee, paid the outsourced tour guide and locked in your terrible flights (or claim to have).  After which zero effort or concern is given – other than:  speak to the airline or tour guide yourself.   Needless to say the Brazil, Argentina, Chile trip is noted as one of the worst if you look up those reviews.  Our arrival flight was not possible due to missed connection times (of budget airlines known to consistently be late), missing a day of excursions.  Of course, once we arrived the following day – it was a “free day” – i.e. local tour guides wouldn’t accommodate any activities, rather asked us to relax for the next day after having already missed the prior day’s activities (i.e. free holiday for them).  Two days gone now.   Brazil, Argentina, & Chile were all great countries – but could have been done just as easily on your own booking with a local guide than with this travel agency.   Now to end the trip at it’s climax, the return flights were not booked correctly with the airlines & their partners (for the code share).  We travelled as 2 couples on identical itineraries.  One couple’s bookings were correctly made, but the airline stated that our booking was made incorrectly by the travel agent Exoticca.com.  Frantically trying get a resolution from the airport (after we were simply dropped at the curb) was impossible.  Customer service was non-existent, except for their “Whatsapp” chat – and every 10 mins they would cut the chat & a new representative would appear asking for our details to start the conversation over again from scratch.  Our flight departed without us – two senior citizens left alone at the airport in a foreign country without any support from this travel agent.  Exoticca via their Whatsapp chat basically told us:  not their problem, deal with the airline – with whom Exoticca booked the tickets on our behalf.   As midnight approached, a supervisor at the airport took sympathy on us being stranded at the airport and helped us rebook the next day on standby flights.  Prior to this the Whatsapp agent for Exoticaa Online Tour Operator agreed that they would reimburse us for the cost of a return flight and told us to make accommodations ourselves (i.e. Exoticca refused in providing any assistance).   But thanks to the airport supervisors’ assistance – we rebooked as standby on different flights and spent the night at the airport hotel in Santiago instead.  Once we were home, we sent Exoticca our receipts and asked if they could reimburse our hotel and the fees we paid to confirm our flight ~$500 total.  This seemed reasonable, since they had agreed to reimburse the cost of new flights (~$1500/each), the night before.  Instead Exoticca offered us a $150 CREDIT for future travel with them instead.  What a complete joke these people are.  Every interaction with their customer support was horrible – it almost felt like we were talking to an AI bot.   You get what you pay for…  RIP OFF.  Hope nothing wrong goes with your trip..  BE PREPARED FOR IT TO GO WRONG with the budget flights and outsourced tour guides Exoticca stick you with.   I do not recommend, absolutely the worst!  There are much better travel agencies to use – this is not a reputed one.Ken K"

2024-07-02,N/A,Unhelpful agents,When I spoke with an agent to help book the trip for two groups. I specifically told Niko the dates and told him to call my friend to book the same exact trip. He didn’t. He booked the wrong dates with her and now she is stuck with the wrong trip. I even called him to book mine 20 minutes after her and I caught the mistake and he was unable to fix it. He never bothered to call back to inform me. I kept calling him to book mine and never got back because he knew he messed up. My friend called customer service and they said no she booked her dates. And I ended up paying a higher cost because Niko never called to book my trip!
2024-07-02,N/A,They were unwilling to work with us on…,"They were unwilling to work with us on changing our tour when Israel was attacked.  We booked a tour of Jordan and Israel in Ocrober the day before Hamas attacked Israel.  After a week, we realized this was a serious matter and asked them to switch our $4,000 deposit to a different tour in another area.  They kept saying they were monitoring the situation and would not let us change. We repeatedly contacted them and told them we were not traveling to Israel under the circumstances.  December 26th they demanded the balance of another $4,000 and when we would not pay they told us we were in default and kept our original payment.  They do not offer the tour we had originally booked but were unwilling to work with us."

2024-07-01,N/A,Feeling Short Changed,I booked the holiday online and shortly afterwards received an email saying they had seen me looking at it and if I phoned a representative they could find me the best deal.

So after MANY phone calls, we were rebooked to the following week.  Show up to the airport and our family of four was booked on SEPARATE ROWS on the aircraft.  Customer service says “Tough luck, you should have addressed that at booking”.  How could I, when THEY rebooked us.  Yeah - last time I use these guys.  Haven’t even left yet and it’s already less than expected…."
2024-06-30,N/A,Too Many Middlemen in Greece,"We went to Greece in June 2024 arranged through Exoticca.  We feel we did not get good value by using this organizer. The most disappointing was the accommodation arrangements for us through the local middleman, Akron, and many of our fellow tour group travellers had the same problems.  The guaranteed 4 star hotels turned out to be a series of backpacker hostel to 3 star hotels at best by North American standards.  What we paid for was not what we got through Exoticca.  The estimated price difference between their accommodations and what they charged us was approx. $3000 CDN.  We will not use them again, at least never in Greece where the star ratings are self-proclaimed, there is NOT A single agency overseeing the designations.  Each local subcontractor takes a cut from Exoticca and the travellers get taken.  Never again."

We tried to call back to get some clarification and no one knew anything about it so we got a bad feeling about it and tried to cancel (this was within 20 minutes of ‘booking’) and they told us they are unable to do so then they hung up the phone when we demanded answers or tried to explain - we also paid for insurance in case we did need to cancel which didn’t seem to matter.It has been hours now of us trying to contact someone without them hanging up on us. Completely unprofessional is this is a legitimate company- DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM"
2024-06-25,N/A,Take screenshots! More interested in profits than client?,"Take screenshots! Within a week or two after booking, we received emails calling for another payment and payment in full months ahead of final payment due date. I logged into portal which show entirely different pay schedule than when booked. Also, we had to cancel our trip. We offered to roll funds paid into a different trip immediately for win-win as company hadn't booked anything yet months into the trip which is another thing that made us nervous. But the company decided it was more important to keep our $3000 and lose a customer for life than have a returning client that referred others. Poor business decision. We plain don't trust this company and will stick with Costco travel from now on. Lesson learned!"

We asked to substitute the guided services from Puerto Natales to the guided services for Santiago to increase to days of guided tour to 3 days instead of one day originally BUT we were told that we will be on our own for 3 days that we were not prepared for.Exoticca has more local resources to make it right for us but using the weather problems to avoid compensating us for the shortage of guided services.After many attempts to email, text via WhatsApp, still no responses."
2024-06-20,N/A,Fraud,"On June 2nd, 2022, I booked a trip to Portugal with Exottica Travel. During the sales call, the agent assured me that I could select my seats or upgrade my flight reservation directly with the airline and pay any additional fees directly to them. However, when I contacted the airline to select my seats or upgrade, I was informed that this could only be done through the third-party agency, Exottica Travel.Upon reaching out to Exottica, I received contradictory solutions from various company representatives. More importantly, they failed to address the core issue of their deceitful and dishonest business practices. My overall experience with Exottica has been extremely disappointing, and I strongly advise others to exercise caution when booking their vacations with them."

Allowed numerous people to come late without reprimanding or encouraging them to be on time. Bus driver did not help to load or unload bags until the last few days. A few sites we could only stay 15 minutes as the bus driver took the wrong turn. Air condition on the bus was broken for 3 days. Hotel in Barcelona had homeless sleeping on the bench outside the hotel. Was informed at the last hotel that ice could not be given to the guests to have a drink in their room.    Guide told us where stores were but they were closed when we got there. Ed should be fired as well as the bus driver. Other guides in the cities and excursions were excellent. Recommendation have customers put a deposit down on microphones so all guides could be heard. They would get their money back at the end of the trip.

2024-06-17,N/A,Scammers beware,"“luxury” hotels were often budget accommodations, far from the promised standard.The customer service at Exoticca is abysmal. My attempts to get clarification on various aspects of the trip were met with long wait times and unhelpful responses. The representatives seemed either poorly trained or intentionally evasive, which is unacceptable for a company dealing with travel logistics. travel arrangements made by Exoticca were consistently substandard. Flights were booked at inconvenient times with long layovers"
2024-06-17,N/A,Refusing to refund flight upgrade fees.,"We have had 2 very successful holidays with Exoticca, firstly Japan and earlier this year the Hashemite Kingdom and Egypt tour. We have booked a 3rd trip, a Kenyan safari for later this year. Exoticca arranged our flights as part of the tour and we took the offered upgrade to Etihad Airways at a cost of £200 extra. Last month we were told that the flights had changed and that we were now given 2 options with Rwanda Air. We responded and said we would choose one of the 2 options but would obviously want our £400 upgrade cost refunded. We have had 2 further exchanges of emails with Exoticca repeatedly saying that they do not refund cancelled options. That I can understand if we cancelled but it was Exoticca who cancelled it. I have each time asked them to escalate the issue but each time they repeat the same refusal. We have also tried to discuss by phone. This has completely soured our previous very favourable view of this company and as things stand we would neither book with nor recommend Exoticca again.UPDATE, re. the Exoticca reply'Thank you for posting your review.We'd like to inform you that the flight change was made by the airline. The extra payment is solely for the flights, and we do not receive a refund or compensation when the airline makes changes.We can see that our support team reached out to you on June 10th. Any further communication can continue through the same thread.'Thank you for restating your position. I am sorry that your arrangement with the airline is such that they will not give you a refund for their changes. Our arrangement is with you and we paid £400 for something that you can no longer deliver.That is why I believe that you should be reducing our oustanding balance by the £400.When you say that your support team reached out to us, they simply restated your position. I asked them to escalate the situation to management, Nothing happened other than restating the position again. Pursuing the situation via your support team takes over a week to get a response, the trustpilot route seems to be 5 or 6 days faster!,regards, James and Gina"

Some people on the tour had no ac the place is also a homeless drug den.  Second hotel was orfeas no hot water. Back to achillion and no ac on a 38c day. Then omiros in Santorini. It’s in the middle of nowhere. No Wi-Fi in the room but ok. Tonight we are at polos at the ports in Paros. Yah the port. Awesome view on the ferry coming in. The room smelled like urine when we checked in. Other couples we given bunk beds. Seriously bunk beds for married couplesThe room is basically a what you would expect from a youth hostel. Contacted Exoticca to demand a fix. Did there watsapp still no response after 6 hours. Funny enough they sent me a request for review and said how awful our trip has been and the got back to me right away. They didn’t do anything. Totally useless but got back to me. My recommendation is go Expedia or travelvelocity. Or wing buddy. Our experience is borderline criminalToday's the 20th and we are back from our trip. They never contact us back or replied to the whatsapp chat.So I priced out the trip they sold us based on todays prices. Everything assumes 2 peopleitem 	costAchillion/4 nights	408orfeas hotel /tours included in get your guide but 4 star	0omiros/Hotel 2 nights	396Polos 2 nights	220Alkitis 2 night	466Flights 	1900athens santo ferry	270santo paros ferry	126paros myk ferry	138myk athens ferry	270Tours	0parthenon get your guide	102delphi/Meteora/hotel get your guide	580transfers taxi	0Airport hotel	67.5hotel acropolis	45santo port	45santo port	45paros port	45paros port	45mykanos port	45mykanos port	45hotel airport	67.5So the cost would be roughly $5400 CDN if I did this myself. They charged us $8600.So as far as I am concerned they owed us $3000 more of value.There is no reason why we should be charged $8600 for $5400 worth of value
2024-06-14,N/A,Failure to respond to phone calls and…,Failure to respond to phone calls and emails. promised free excursions which I was charged for.   Canceled trip a week after scheduling but received no refund.  I will never use your company  again and will never recommend you to my friends
2024-06-14,N/A,Cannot send email to customer,Cannot send email to customerService. Have gotten several emails from customerservice   @  exoticca.comWhen I try to respond back the emails do not go through. They keep bouncing back. This is very frustrating and unprofessional
2024-07-08,N/A,Don't see the $4500 in my wallet,"As before, it was easy to book a trip and the prices are great. However, the June deal of $4500 never went into my exoticca wallet. One month later, and a couple of phone calls to Exoticca, and still not promotional deal in our Exoticca wallet.  No sure what is going on"
2024-06-13,N/A,Couldn't run a bath,Make promises that they cant keep then when you query they give the standard excuses straight out of the customer handbook instead of trying to resolve your issues.
2024-06-13,N/A,It was not as expected,It was not as expected. We’ve been on tours before and they were guided throughout the entire vacation. This was an unguided vacation. Basically this is just a travel agency booking your trip. This is generally what I do when we go on vacation. I think they have too expensive of an up charge on any variations. The flights are inflexible. Overall I didn’t enjoy the process. Everyone we worked with was friendly but the system once booked made it difficult to ask questions or make changes. I would not use them again.
2024-06-13,N/A,Poor customer service,I needed to change the date for this booking but was told I couldn’t without losing my deposit.I think it is unreasonable to not allow for changes within 24 hours.I will not be buying from Exoticaa again and have stopped recommending you to people.
2024-06-14,N/A,Didn’t like deposit policy,"I can understand why Exoticca might require a deposit, but I don’t understand why the deposit would be nonrefundable, especially when it’s advance the travel date.Sorry, your response doesn't help. My circumstance was such that I was booking in advance by 6 months or so, such that there was (likely) plenty of time before ticket commitments might be made. Also, isn't this a situation where Exottica could notify the customer that tickets must be purchased, and then convert the refundable deposit to non-refundable at some nearby date.Again, I can see why you might require a (nonrefundable) deposit after some point. And it seems to me that Exottica pointing me in the direction of ""cancellation protection"" protects/covers Exottica, at the expense of the customer. So this seems like a strategic move by Exottica to extract more revenue from customers who wish to protect themselves."

You should never purchase a trip via wire. Filed a complaint with my credit card company and after some back & forth my deposit was refunded by TM.
2024-06-13,N/A,"Worst Experience, Zero Star Rating for Exoticca","No answer to any of my phone calls.  Left messages with no return phone calls. No response to any of my emails.  Finally, when I decided to cancel our trip with Exoticca, I received a phone call from Exoticca.  I have rather forfeit my deposit for our trip then going with an organization with no heart.  If there is a rating of ZERO STAR, THAT WOULD BE MY RATING FOR EXOTICCA."

2024-06-14,N/A,I booked a trip to Galapagos and the…,"I booked a trip to Galapagos and the next day you offered a $4500 credit for booking the exact same Galapagos trip. I asked for compassion and for the credits offered and another company would’ve given us the credit to ensure we book more trips with your company but you flat outright said no! So based on your being anything but customer friendly, we will never book another trip with this heartless company. If I could give you zero stars, I would. *Jist a follow up. Exotica send a reply saying how sorry they are that I don’t qualify. Saying an agent had contacted me which none had and too bad I booked before the promo. (Which was a mere 18 hours before the promo) it was signed by “Exoticca” and no name was attached so no “real” person took any responsibility. I feel that this company has front line agents and the rest is all AI generated and the response seems to be the same “you booked one day early and don’t qualify” I told another couple who were going to come with us and they aren’t going to book as they said it sounds like a shady company with robots making decisions and not caring for their customers. I have seen many bad reviews since booking. Just beware. Exotica will take your money and that’s it. If I could cancel with a full refund, I would. A real person in a real company would go over and above for their customers. Not Exoricca!!"

Very lousy customer service, no manager to talk with. Still waiting for your customer service rep to solving my overcharged money back to my credit card. Can anyone there help?"
2024-06-13,N/A,Lack customer service,"I directly called the phone number provided prior to booking my next trip to Japan as the pricing seemed high for the room upgrade.  I was asked to cancel my first placeholder reservation by the agent and then rebook.  Two weeks later, the price for the same trip was lower based on the room upgrade.  NO one in the company has been able to assist me with a price adjustment.  All I've gotten was, ""the company has a right to adjust the pricing and you are to pay the agreed price at the time of booking"".  It's their own pricing that I want adjusted."
2024-06-13,N/A,Non cooperation of Exotica staff,"I bought trip for Portugal & Spain thru your agent.  The day I paid him 60% deposit he was very happy.  Next day I called him, he didn't respond, my phone ,emails.  I talked to other agents, but no help. The agent had told me i can switch airlines to reserve early seats.  They assigned me Delta, which will not reserve/purchase seats.  Whenever I call Exotica, the voice mail will tell me to wait several hours talk to agent, or fill up form on line and wait 5 days. Which is ridiculous. I am not going to use Exotica any more."
2024-06-13,N/A,Do not use this conpany!!,"If I had the option of 0 stars, I would have used it. This company uses very aggressive sales techniques, but at least you can reach the sales people. Onc you book a trip, it is almost impossible to get anyone on thke phone to ask questions. Making even the slightest changes for any reason results in a stone wall on. inflexibility. Also, they nickel and dime you to death....almost everything is an extra charge of some kind. Each of the various departments (e.g. sales, customer service for existing trips and travel) do not communicate with each other, so you must explain everything to everyone. In addition, the people you talk to say they have no authority to make decisions and.In am an experienced travel and have working with many travel organizations in Europe, Africa and Asia. This one is by far te worst."
2024-06-12,N/A,Bad customer service,"It took me a very long time to reach someone for help. Many phone calls, long waits on hold, passed around many times. When I did finally reach someone who was supposed to be able to help me, I was told I had to leave a message and someone would call me back. I have waited for weeks and no one has called back. When you finally reach someone, they are very polite and friendly but they can't help you."
2024-06-14,N/A,Horrific Experience,Horrible to deal with.   You sit on hold for actual hours before you can talk to someone in customer service.  Told me one amount for a refund then told me a different amount so I got no money back.  It was explained as “human error”. I would never deal with them in the future. Worst of all is that all we wanted was a credit on a future trip.  And the reason we had to cancel was I needed emergency surgery. It was a nightmare of an experience.   We book trips on line all of the time and it was always a great experience until we booked with exotica.  Buyer beware!

The government is warning travellers not to attend and they won’t let me visit elsewhereUpdate review. So exoticca replied to me saying that safety is their priority yet the Canadian Government instructs us not to attend because of the high risk of terrorism. Exoticca says that their regular terms and conditions apply if I cancel. And that means I lose everything. This is a totally insensitive response.The government says exercise high degree of caution due to terrorism risk and to avoid all travel to the border regions of the Western Sahara.I am a senior and I take these government cautions seriously. When I asked your team if there were any such cautions the representative did not disclose this detail. I think you are wrong here.

2024-06-20,N/A,SCAM!!,"SCAM!!! I recently booked a trip and flight with Exoticca Travel Agency on June 2nd, 2024, and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. The primary issue arose from the agency's failure to fulfill their commitment regarding seat selection for the flight.During the booking process, I specifically requested seat reservations for my flights. The agent assured me that seat selection would be available within approximately 24 hours through the Exoticca app. However, when I attempted to select my seats on June 4th, I was informed by the airline that seat selection had to be facilitated by the third-party travel agency.Upon contacting Exoticca, I received reassurance via email that seat selection could be arranged without issue. However, this assurance was later contradicted in another email on June 6th, where it was stated that advanced seat selection may require payment, a detail not disclosed during the booking process.Further complications arose on June 11th when Exoticca informed me that they were unable to select seats for my flights and advised me to contact the airline directly. Finally, on June 12th, when I attempted to cancel my trip and request a refund due to Exoticca's failure to provide promised services, including seat selection, I was informed that I would not be eligible for any refund.Overall, my experience with Exoticca Travel Agency has been deeply disappointing. Not only did they fail to fulfill their obligations regarding seat selection, but they also demonstrated a lack of transparency and willingness to rectify their mistakes or provide compensation. I strongly advise caution when considering booking with Exoticca, as my experience has left me frustrated and dissatisfied.06/20/2024 Booking number was provided to Exoticca on 06/15/2024. I'm waiting for a response."
2024-06-12,N/A,Poor planning / execution,3rd party coordinator at Santorini failed to effectively support travelers. Nobody at hotel  to guide arrival. Written messages left at front desk were not addressed by name and as a result only received 24 hours later. In Athens our assigned hotel was changed but only after our arrival at the wrong location leaving us to scramble with luggage to find the new accommodation. Our assigned hotel on our last night in Athens was a disaster...nobody should be booked in that place ever!

Your employees knew from my first call that Exoticca made a mistake. My credit company is helping me get my money back. My receipt show the amount I agreed for but then right after that $2700 was added. I asked for explanation but it was never answered. We loved our first experience but this is poorly handled from the start. Get this fixed and refund this extra charge

2024-06-12,N/A,I recently traveled to Peru with…,"I recently traveled to Peru with Exotica and unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. There were several key issues that significantly detracted from our trip.Firstly, communication with Exotica was consistently poor. Before and during the trip, it was difficult to get timely and clear responses to our questions and concerns. This lack of communication created a lot of frustration and uncertainty.We also encountered major issues with our accommodations. Despite paying for the premium package, the hotels we were assigned were far from premium quality. One hotel in particular was extremely disappointing. Our room was on the ground floor with no windows, making it feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable. Given that we had paid extra for a higher standard of accommodation, this was unacceptable.To add to the disappointment, Exotica did not offer any compensation for this subpar experience. Instead, they provided a voucher for a future trip, which we have no intention of using given our dissatisfaction with their services. The voucher felt like an inadequate attempt to address the issue rather than a genuine effort to rectify the situation.Overall, the combination of poor communication and substandard accommodations made for a disappointing trip. I would not recommend Exotica for travel to Peru, as our experience fell well below expectations."

2024-06-19,N/A,bank transfer for payment costs customer an extra charge,"same trips.   dont like bank transfer for final payment. ( costs customer an additional fee to send the bank transfer )  Dont like that wallet perks expire rather quickly.   dont like that they do not wave single suppliment like other companies do.  I have been on 2 trips with them so far and have 2 more pending.  They recently switched to bank transfer (for final payment) AFTER i had previously purchased trips .   I think thats unfair as i had no idea the final payments would mean i would have to go to my bank to complete payment and unable to do it online. (at an additional cost as well)  The trips i had were good.  Except Rome, where i caught bedbugs.   No partial refund or anything from the company, and left word with tour guide and hotel. No communication back at all about this.I also just got off the phone with you.  I was just told that people on a single suppliment cant book extra excursions on the Turkey trip.  Now why would i fly to Turkey, Pay extra to go on the single suppliment, and not be allowed on any excursions?   This is crazy.  I know its not true as i went to Rome and did extra excursions as a single person.  I have been trying for months to book extra excursions and i am unable.  I am about to cancel this particular upcoming trip if this is the case.  NOWHERE does it say on your website that single people cant do excursions in Turkey.also, my upcoming trip to Pompeii (italy)  same thing.  I cant book extra excurions.  This trip is in september and i am still unable to book anything. Incedentally, I am NOT going on a single suppliment on this trip and STILL cant book things offered online.   With no answer as to why.  Just that the tour operater may have not opened the booking.  The trip is 90 days out and i should be able to secure excursions at this time.   Right now, my rating has lowered about the company because this is a HUGE issue.ALso, the Turkey trip does not even give the PRICES of the excursions (that i am not allowed to purchase) and thats not fair as i do not want an unexpected $1000+ bill in the end.   The fact that i was just told single suppliment people cant do excursions is insane.I got a email from you today appologizing for stuff.  Thank you for that but you did not adress the issue of me being told single suppliment people cant book excursions.  Then you said it was i cant book ""fist"" because at least 2 people need to book for it to happen.  well, fine.  But that does not appear to be the case because i am TRYING to book for my Italy/Pompeii trip (extra excursions) and 2 of us are going on that trip and i STILL Cant do it.  So clearly that is not the issue.  ALso, i went to Rome, and booked excursions as a single person when i booked the trip.  So this does not add up to me.  And i keep getting a generic reply from you and the part about the other trip with 2 travelers keeps getting ignored.if you acknowledge the issue that would be a start.  If you would explain why i was told single people cant purchase first, when i am trying to purchase on another trip with 2 people, that would be nice too.  Clearly its a website issue- which i was told about on a previous call with you.  I was told that i would get another discount because of this and the fact that prices are NOT listed.  I told your operator that i wouldnt book the trip not knowing the total cost of excursions because it could potentially run me a extra grand.   She agreed, booked it, and said i could add the excursions later and they would offer a discount.  Needless to say, i am told otherwise now.  Plus still cant book anything, regardless if its 1 or 2 people going.   And i was told i wouldnt get a discount.  Now who would BLINDLY book a trip, KNOWING they cant book any extra excursions and if they COULD, not be told the price of any of them?  This does not seem good business nor would i ""make it up""  as has been insinuated in exoticca emails sent to me.  I would GLADLY change my review, if this would be worked out, but each day i get a email, its blown off.I am about to publish your reply email to me so others can see you keep blowing off the booking issue that is the REAL problem.*** PLease answer about the trip in 79 days.  The trip to ITALY!!   2 of us are going and i cant purchase excursions.  PLEASE answer about that trip then.    You 1/2 answer things.   I am SUPPOSED to have excursions paid for by JULY 6.... Its June 16th already... I CANT pay for them and you wont answer that half of my question.  * Id give you a negative star if i could at this point.  also, NOBODY has reached out and called and i have also sent in more emails about this issue.I got a call on sunday the 16th.  They asked me what extras i wanted.  I told them and they said THEY would book it over the phone for me.  THEY COULDNT even book it over the phone  (i have till the 6th of july... tick toc time is running out) and would email me a price and option to pay for it.  This is the ITALY trip in SEPT w 2 people.   No emails and no replies still.  nothing solved"

Please do it book with this company they will completely ruin your trip. They will change your flight details after you have made payments. Fail to give you your trip itinerary and lie about what is actually on offer. The give you misinformation and have completely breaches GDPR so do not give them your information. They left us for three days in a tent with no heating. They claimed we would have an all inclusive trip and it was not. They changed the details of our trip which meant we spent many extra days actually travelling than in the countries themselves and they gave us the wrong baggage information and did not update it for 2 out of 6 of our flights. Also why do we have 6 flights on one less than two week trip! One was after travelling over 6 hours by coach! And having to wait in the airport for another 4 hours. They did not give us our correct itinerary or booking information for the trip so we had nasty surprises along the way.
2024-06-10,N/A,This is the worst possible agency that…,"This is the worst possible agency that I have ever dealt with! I booked a top of the line vacation to Portugal including dinners and attractions and when I had to undergo emergency surgery they would not allow me to make any changes, even to just reschedule as I was not asking for refund but at least reschedule, they kept my money and stated the insurance clause on the vacation only covered if they cancelled!!!This is unprofessional and unacceptable, I will never use them again and will caution anyone since obviously emergencies are unpredictable and there should be flexibility in business when you have supporting documentation!"
2024-06-10,N/A,TERRIBLE HOLIDAY and awful customer…,"TERRIBLE HOLIDAY and awful customer service.Recently came back from a 10 day holiday in GREECE. I really don’t think Exoticca vet the places/hotels/holidays they are selling/providing/promoting. We stayed in a part of Athens that was so rough we were told by two different people not to go out at night and if we did to only turn right. We then realised that by turning right the riot police were at the top of the road and patrolled the area at night. What a complete shock to hear this and given that we were a party of females with a  13 year old child in tow how worrying was that for us. Going on holiday you want to explore, I completely understand that every country has their issues and there is good and bad everywhere but this holiday was awful. There was so much wrong with this holiday it’s a lot to list (I.e. dirty hotel rooms with urine stains all over the toilet)but they even expected 2 adults and a 13 year older child to sleep in one double bed. I’m completely lost for words, then to top it off I  emailed the company to inform of my disappointment in what was provided and they didn’t even respond. Had to send another email today and decided to write this review. Shocking service and really poor holiday, pay a bit more and go somewhere else."
2024-05-31,N/A,I have a trip booked for October 3.24,I have a trip booked for October 3.24 . The second person cannot make the trip so I asked Exoticca to change the name to my son. I contacted the airlines and was informed this was no problem. Exoticca has refused to change the name on the reservation and the options are to lose my $3500 deposit or pay the balance and go alone. The reservation has no changes and the itinery is not finalized until 2 weeks before departure. The trip is 4 months from now. I am told these are the terms and names cannot be changed. How is that for customer satisfaction. This would be my 4th trip with Exoticca.
2024-05-29,N/A,Poor Customer Service!,"Last week, my friend and I booked a holiday to South Africa for 16 days, costing £2,800 each. We discussed flights with a sales agent called Sun and chose a direct flight with BA. At the time of booking, Sun told us that the flight did not include hold luggage and we would have to contact BA to add our bags.The next day, I telephoned BA and was told one hold bag would cost £70 each way per person, ie £140 each, but if Exoticca changed our flight from “Economy Basic” to “Economy Standard” at an extra cost of £24 each way, it would include a 23kg bag. We immediately contacted Exoticca to request this change (we were not allowed to do this ourselves) and have spoken at length to several Customer Service agents, as well as writing emails. Surprisingly, for a large travel agent that focuses on customer satisfaction, they have not helped us in any way.  We have received the obligatory apology but that does not compensate us for the unnecessary extra cost to be incurred, for a simple administration task for the Exoticca airline booking department. This has clearly been a booking error by Exoticca, as what person could go on a 16 day package holiday with hand luggage only!This whole experience has caused my friend and I doubts as to the organisation of our forthcoming holiday in October, which we were excited to book.We were asked to write a review after we made the booking and this is our unfortunate experience so far."
2024-05-29,N/A,This company offered us a tour of…,This company offered us a tour of Portugal with a small group of no more than 24 people.  Instead we were on a bus with 42 people.  A ridiculous amount of time was wasted herding people and transporting between hotels. I would never have booked it knowing that it would be that many people.  I would recommend never using this company between the bait and switch and their unwillingness to compensate for their failure to provide what was advertised!
2024-05-27,N/A,We Were Lied To,"We were planning a trip to Costa Rica and checked out a few options including Exoticca. We landed on the dates for our trip and unfortunately when we went to book, the price had gone up by $300 per person. Because of the price increase we decided not to book at that time. However a customer representative from Exoticca contacted us because they clearly wanted to make the sale.We told them that the reason we did not complete our booking was because of the price increase so the representative promised us a $300 discount on each booking. Great! We booked under the pretence that we would be refunded $300 per person for a total of $600.This is when things turned. It became clear that Exoticca did not want to fulfill their promise of a discount. After multiple calls which Exoticca attempted to dodge, we were told that we were not promised a discount. WHAT?? We kept trying and eventually were given a discount on one booking. Just half of what we were promised! We booked after being told that we would be given a discount and it turns out that we were blatantly lied to.Exoticca lied to us in order to get us to book and has since not given us the discount which they assured we would get. Do not trust this company!"
2024-05-26,N/A,7 day tour Turkey - don’t!,"7 day tour Turkey - Istanbul, Ankara and Cappadocea.The organisation was very poor. Meet and greet at the airport was invisible. Times of trips were altered without notice, and the entire itinerary was changed without us being told. We spent 1 1/2 hours in a minibus waiting while the driver, guide and office argued about the sequence of dropoff for a planned transfer from airport to hotel.  When approached about this the Exoticca office were dismissive and arrogant. They were similarly rigid and unhelpful when we requested a later return to the airport for our flight home - they insisted in transferring us so we arrived over 4 hours early in spite of having checked in and travelling with hand luggage only.Some meals were pre booked but were dreadful. Hotels were satisfactory and some guides were good.I will be hesitant about using Exoticca again after this experience."
2024-05-24,N/A,The worst travel operator ever.,The worst travel operator ever.I recommend all travellers never trust you.
2024-05-24,N/A,HOTELS,THE AGENT I SPOKE COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT PUT ME THRU TO A MANAGER WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT 2 BOOKINGS I HAVE.   THERE ARE 2 RESERVATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING OUT OF 2 DIFFERENT CITIES AND I WOULD NOT BE GUARANTEED THEY ARE IN THE SAME HOTELS AND I MAY HAVE 2 MORE COUPLES THAT MAY GO ALSO
2024-05-23,N/A,I would advise anyone who has already…,"South America Tour May 2024I would advise anyone who has already booked with this company to check all flights/baggage and hotel reservations before departure in great detail.  If you have requested twin and/or superior rooms then email the hotel direct to check that these have actually been booked) chances are they haven't.  Do not rely on Exoticca.If you haven't booked a holiday already then proceed with caution.  If you have a straight forward double (or solo) booking  and nothing goes wrong then it could be a stressless experience.Less that 2 hours before we were due to leave by taxi for our flight to Buenos Aires (on a 2 hour journey to Heathrow) I just happened to check my email to discover our flights had been cancelled (the day before!!) I had already 'checked in' on line but no phone call or text from Exoticca.  Any airline will notify you immediately of such a major change but of course BA informed the agent Exoticca and they didn't pass this information onto us until much later the next day..... by email?!!  We did manage to secure a flight 24 hours later but lost a day of our holiday.Please check all your baggage allowances direct with the individual airlines.  I was able to do this and check our reservations with the flight booking codes provided.  Some travellers were unaware of the different baggage restrictions on different airlines and were charged.We are 4 single ladies and had requested twin rooms when booking the trip and again on final payment. This was essential.  We were assured this had been requested and had been added to our paperwork.  It had not however been requested.  The hotels showed us the documentation from Exoticca requesting double rooms throughout.  Not a single hotel had twin rooms pre-booked?!  This didn't just happen to us but to other people we met travelling with Exoticca. We had to pay extra at one hotel and I ended up emailing the other hotels direct myself who confirmed twins had not been requested!Don't pay extra for superior accommodation.  Those that had paid additional amounts ended up in hotels further out and complained that their rooms were below standard.  Expect Hotels/rooms to be below quality expected on occasion. Many travellers that we met had changed rooms or requested a change of hotel.Don't pay for extra tours before you go.  You can purchase much cheaper in destination or often 'tours' aren't  necessary so wait until you get there.However I can confirm that once we no longer relied on Exoticca, and had arrived in the destinations and the 'local travel agent' took over it seemed to be well organised.  The transfers were prompt and we enjoyed the tours. In other words once you don't have any further contact with Exoticca communication and assistance locally is much improved.  That was the case Argentina and Brazil anyway.If you are looking for a proper tour experience and a company who you can communicate with promptly and trust then leave well alone.We won't be using Exoticca again."
2024-05-23,N/A,I had recent trp in Norway through…,"I had recent trp in Norway through Exoticca. I arrived in the middle of the night and they changed my hotel. I took a taxi then when I arrived at the hotel the receptionist said that I was booked in another hotel. The receptionist there helped me get a taxi again. I called Exoticca but they were not able to help me iN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT! In the morning, I have learned that most of us had messed up accommodation. I think its a scam that they deliberately messed up our accommodation so that we will not continue and so Exoticca will not refund."
2024-05-29,N/A,Disappointing,"On 5/2/2024, my husband & I planned to book a trip to Portugal for 8/21-29. Exoticca has offered us a credit discount of $300. I emailed Exoticca to confirm if the discount is per person. Instead, I got a response if we are still interested & to call. Tried calling 3 times but either I was put on a long hold on the phone or could not connect w our contact person.  When I checked our desired dates, they are already sold out. Due to inefficient customer service & their delays in responding, the credit voucher has also expired. I was so disappointed.  I have now rebooked a different trip without any help from Exoticca’s staff.  For future travels, I may have to think twice before using them.Got a response from Exotica (below) saying that  our other trip has been completed with their staff's assistance. Sorry to inform them but that trip has been booked myself on line without their support assistance. It's much better to do it myself than wait for their response anyway.!"
2024-06-08,N/A,Do not double chrage me for the same trip,"Today is 6/8/24, Exoticca promised to refund my money that they overcharged; but nothing happened, I called my credit card dispute center's manager, and they said Exoticca did not process my refund. I called Exoticca this morning from 9am to 12pm, 3 hours, no one picked up the phone call.Exoticca - did you not see tons of complaints about your company? you replied that you'd solve this problem, but it's not true, what is going on with your agency?I swapped the trips (just paid the deposit in May); Exoticca said they'd apply the credits from the original booking to the new booking ( the same trip); but it's a nightmare talking with many reps there and still not solving the issues. They double-charged me for the same trip. Would never use them in the future. DO NOT USE THEM!!"
2024-05-21,N/A,Madagascar with Exoticca - Avoid!Despite leaving a scathing report on,"Despite leaving a scathing report on Exoticca’s site they replied with congratulations on my “wonderful holiday” and asked me to leave a review here! So here it is. Our trip to Madagascar from Apr. 16 to May 3rd was an unmitigated disaster. The name of the holiday suddenly changed from “Madagascar, Land of the Baobabs” to “The Great Road Trip” . The distances between hotels and the road conditions were so appalling that we spent up to 15 hours per day being thrown around in a small bus. The estimated travel times given by Exoticca bore no relation to the actual travelling times.  Our itinerary  included such suggestions as “ wander round the town at your leisure” difficult when we arrived in the dark at  8.00pm after leaving the previous hotel before dawn! We were up most days around 4.00am to complete the day’s gruelling travel. A holiday? This was sheer torture. How could anyone from Exoticca possibly have reconnoitred this trip and dreamed it feasible??"
2024-05-21,N/A,"Tried Exotica twice, DON’T USE!!!","ZERO HELPFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!I’ve used Exotica twice. Italy was my worse experience ever. You had to pay to go to every hotel by taxi yourself and find every place on your own. No transfers to hotels or airports. Guides don’t show up. Exoticca was called by everyone waiting for the guide at the  Colleseum to show up. My phone bill was so high from calling. They told us he was there. They told us to look at two different place to find them. We had around 15 people that we didn’t know, calling and looking everywhere that we did. Exoticca told me he did not show up. We paid again so we can see the Coliseum, because we wouldn’t be back. They would not refund that excursion either.Just went to Switzerland. My husband had a detached retina. We did not have travel insurance. We booked an excursion with Exoticca to take on the seventh day for almost $400. My guide told me that Exotica canceled my flight for my husband and my excursion. Exotica called me a liar saying that he can’t possibly know that. They got the money back, and will give me zero in return. This is an awful, awful company. Please go with Gate one or smarttours. I travel the world. I’ve used many companies that I book myself, through their company. I’ve never had such irresponsible business owners as this one. They lost me who booked four trips with them. I’m warning you. They also make u take your luggage into the hotel and into your room yourself and when you’re leaving do the same thing bring your luggage to the lobby and then outside yourself. We went to seven different hotels and had to do this each day. Everyone said that their backs were hurting badly by the end of the trip. I don’t want to say “I told you so”. I’m not a disgruntled client, I just want my money back for an excursion that wasn’t used, and I was told it was canceled and call or text Exoticca to get my money back.EXOTICCA said it never canceled my husbands flight or his excursion. The airplane trip from Lisbon to Newark had someone sitting next to me. This proved they did cancel my husband’s flight and lied to me. They are good at lying.Now EXOTICCA wants more information. I have written them and twice they said they will get in touch with me. I have never heard from them.We have another trip booked with them, and are very sorry we do.Another thing they don’t tell you is, if they give you credits, you can’t combine them. I had a $500 credit for booking a trip. I had $100 credit from having friends book with me. I had a $75 credit because of their screw up. I was only allowed to use one of the credits towards a trip. Ridiculous, right. Give you credits and you can’t possibly use them. Any which way they can, they will avoid the right thing. Someone I know, was owed $90. It took five phone calls and 90 days to get that money back. This is unacceptable.I also tried to speak to a supervisor. That didn’t happen either.Sherri and Ron VanSantUS-EX2023194916"
2024-05-19,N/A,The holiday that never was,"Do to a power outage at Stansted airport coupled with Play Airlines refusing to accept our check-in baggage due the automated baggage system not working we missed our flight. Exoticca were useless in providing emergency help and in arranging alternative solutions. They even refused to accept joint liability that their sub contractor Play Airlines acted negligently and was in breach of contract. Needless to say we never went on holiday and lost £2,000 as a result."
2024-05-19,N/A,This is a deceitful company that tries…,"This is a deceitful company that tries to make money by keeping people in the dark about what type of conditions they are going to meet on their holiday.As a customer you book in good faith thinking that reasonable conditions for the traveller will be provided.We were told the day before our internal flight from Xian to Guilin that i the flight was going to be at 6 am, and that we had to leave the hotel at 4 am.This meant getting up in the middle of the night at 3 am, which is not anyone's idea of a pleasant trip.This is only acceptable if the customer is fully aware of it and accepts it, which was certainly not the case.If the customer is told at the time of booking, that is fair enough. But to deliberately hide it is fraud.On the contrary, it was deliberately hidden from us despite requesting that information a number of times.These practices are totally unacceptable as they reek of fraud.For the 3 am wake up to take the 6 am flight, we were provided with a breakfast box (hardboiled egg, two small buns, banana, water and yoghurt) from the hotel. We were meant to eat this at 4 pm on the minibus in the dark as he could not put light on the bus. Nothing is provided on the plane save a lukewarm herbal tea. We could not take the breakfast on the plane as we could not take water nor yoghurt, so it was discarded or eaten at 4pm in the dark. I really was not hungry in there middle of the night.To add insult to injury, the guide in Xi'An asks about preferences for seat such as aisle or window or middle, and the only thing that was important to us was to have seats together, and even that was not provided, we were put in some separate leftover seats. I am very angry about all this.On top ofWorth noting also that other people in our group did not have seats together in the train from Beijing to Xi'An, and we were spread over 3 carriages. We were 13 people in the group.Hotels allocated matched in no way to the description in the schedule, most of them were not the headline hotel shown, but one of the others in a long lists in very small print underneath.They were all old hotels which had not been renovated for about 20 years and had seen better days, with mould in bathrooms, broken glass balcony banister, damaged bathroom door so that it squeeked so much that we could not close it when using it at night. Apart from that they were very old in style with everything brown and dark, worn wallpaper, faded flowers.They were not off a modern design such as fire example a Marriot or a Holiday Inn, and always located quite far from the tourist attractions to visit, so that we spent many hours stuck in traffic in the tour minibus. It was quicker to go by metro even though we were generally practically at the end of a metro line.I will contact ABTA to complain about this practice.I do not recommend the guide in Xi'An as he is complicit to these lies, did not book us seats together as promised and then said nothing, and is difficult to understand. His English is dodgy too as he does not understand the work ""where"", as in, where exactly do we meet, which is kind of a basic word for a guide I would have thought.I would not have booked this trip with this company it's they had given us the information before. I woke very happily have been more to escape these awful holiday conditions.In Guilin WE were in the hotel Guilin Bravo which is in a good location at the lakes and recently refurbished so definitively gives a luxurious feel, particularly compared to the other hotels so far on the trip. The hotel in Yangshuo was particularly bad and I would say unacceptable unless you are on a backpacker trip.Unfortunately the Bravos swimming pool was closed and is only open in the summer according to the hotel, it is an outdoor pool but this is a tropical place where it is more than warm enough now in April.The breakfast is not very good here, lacks variety compared to the hotel on Beijing and Xi'An.Flight was changed by phone call to the hotel room giving us details only verbally, no way to contact anyone now any details in writing on the internet as would be normal in this day and age. The app always shows zero information about internal fights or trains."
2024-05-19,N/A,DO NOT BOOK WITH EXOTICCA,"I have filed a complaint with the Maryland Attorney General's Office. Here is my complaint.I am claiming suspicious, unethical and/or illegal business practices by Exoticca. Their business practice is to collect 60% of the cost of a trip with the remaining 40% of the balance due before trip is scheduled. There are no changes allowed once the trip is scheduled. If any changes are needed to the reservation, then the cost of the change is 60% of the total cost of the trip (the exact amount collected as the deposit/first payment). It is my belief that the business model for Exoticca is to collect the 60% and expect that a bulk of the customers will need to make changes, thus forfeiting the 60% submitted. Following is my experience with Exoticca.I booked a Galapagos trip, which included airfare, for two through Exoticca on December 30, 2023. The trip is scheduled for September 5-16 and the cost is $8,100. I paid an initial deposit on December 30, 2023 of $1,639 and an additional payment made on January 9, 2024 of $3,279.60 for a total of $4,919.60.In February, I received an email from American Airlines stating that the tram at the Miami airport was closed for repairs and to allocate additional time for our connecting flight from Miami to Quito (the ticket already showed a short connection time).  My flights time are as follows:PHL to MIA 1:58 pm departure, arrival at 4:50 pmMIA to          5:35 pm departure, arrival at 8:48 pmI contacted Exoticca customer service immediately to let them know of the AA email. I asked them to submit a request to change my AA reservation from a 1:58 pm departure time to a 11:53 am, which would give us almost three hours to make the connection rather than 45 minutes. The Exoticca representative said to submit the AA email to them for proof. I submitted the AA email and received an email from Exoticca stating that the request was not approved; that no changes could be made to reservation based on their contract with AA.  Upon receiving the Exoticca email, I called AA and spoke to a representative about the AA email sent to me and requesting that change the reservation. The AA representative stated that the Exoticca was the “owner” of the ticket and, as such, they were the only ones that could request the change. When I told her of my conversation with the Exoticca representative, she stated that that person needs to be retrained; that they just needed to submit a waiver request and it would more than likely be approved since AA asked me to allot more time for my connection in Miami. She also said to wait a month or two to see if the flight times changed during that time. I waited.On May 3, 2024 my husband had an MRI, found out that he had a ruptured anterior fibial tendon that would need emergency surgery. Surgery was scheduled for May 13. The surgeon stated that my husband would be in a cast for four months, followed by a boot for another eight months.  He was told that he was not to put any weight on the injured foot for three months, not to participate in any activity (such as golf) for at least a year and no air travel for a year because of the potential of blot clots. My husband has polycythemia vera which increases the chances of blot clots after surgery. Upon receiving the news, I called Exoticca and spoke to a representative to request a postponement of our reservation.  The representative stated that there were no changes allowed to the reservation. If I wanted to make a change, then the penalty was 60% of the cost of the trip. I told him the reason for the request and he told me to submit documentation of the diagnosis and treatment plan by the surgeon. I requested a letter from the surgeon stating the diagnosis and treatment plan. The office manager said she would call Exoticca to see what they required. On May 8, the office manager told me that she had spent thirty minutes the prior day talking to three different people at Exoticca and got the runaround. She said it was very frustrating and got no answers. Thus, the office manager provided me with a letter to submit to Exoticca stating the diagnosis and treatment plan. On the morning of May 9, I submitted the letter from the surgeon. On the afternoon of May 9, I received an email back from Exoticca stating if you wish to make a change the penalty is $4,919.40.Exoticca financially benefits if any changes are made by a customer whether nor not medical or travel insurance is obtained by the customer. The change policy is of dubious ethics and is based on greed rather than customer service.  Exoticca appears to be an extortion company masking as a travel company. For many, Exoticca is collecting and keeping money without providing a service.(Not submitting a request to change an airline ticket when it would not have cost anything to the company exemplifies your business policies.)"
2024-05-16,N/A,Impossible to reach customer service…,"Impossible to reach customer service with any question. Strongly recommend NOT using this company, you will be very disappointed, unless you like drama in your life."
2024-05-14,N/A,Run don't walk to any other company!,"It all started off with non english speaking drivers, trips without guides, our vehicle rear ended by another vehicle hired by Exoticca, splitting our group and sending half to a very nice resort while the balance of us were sent to a dump. (Overwhelmingly agreed upon by all members of our group.)No customer service satisfaction. In fact no return calls from anyone, just canned email responses. Despite numerous requests to have someone call us, no one has.Above all, if you have a chance to travel with another company, run, don't walk to them. Stay away form Exoticca. There's a reason why they are rated 2.5 out of five with the BBB. Don't take my word for it, check it out yourself."
2024-05-14,N/A,Terrible,"Terrible! Will not be using Exoticca anytime soon.I would argue that your choice of flights were poor in the first place. If you can’t meet the journey as advertised you should refund the trip. You have insurance don’t you? If not you should be taking responsibility for your poor flight choices and flight company you use, imo."
2024-05-11,N/A,A bad trip,"We have to walk more than 6 miles on May 1st due to rally and demonstration.  The travel company should know it and make some change on the schedule.  The tour guide told us the pick up time for transfer to airport is 4:30 a.m., but the driver come at 3:50 a.m. and force us to go to lobby in 10 minutes while we are not ready at all."
2024-05-13,N/A,Exoticca Greece 11 day trip,"Exoticca subcontracted this trip out to a company named Akron Travel in Greece who in turned subbed out other parts of the trip. There was no consistency and very little communication or direction most of the trip. The places were pretty and we did have some good guides, mostly in the country. I would not suggest this trip to anyone who is looking for a seamless experience. I was very disappointed"
2024-05-09,N/A,All stop point were closed stay in…,All stop point were closed stay in London just 30 mins.
2024-05-07,N/A,Skip this poor planning,"Got to hotel at 6 am we slept on lobby chairs they would not give us a cup of coffee because we didn’t, have a room number(holiday inn) room not ready till 3 pm picture of cable car ride not included in your tour ( had to figure out metro to be able to have that experience ..week included 2 holidays everything closed …too much free time ..hotel in business district nothing but coffee shops and pastries :::would not recommend"
2024-05-06,N/A,Dissapointed traveller,"HelloFellow travellers, I thought I'd inform everyone to be aware when they are booking with Exotica. We have been to Morocco, and it was excellent; Turkey was very disorganised once we lost a bag on the bus. There were so many mixed up with various groups, and we had to wait hours before we got the bag.We booked the next trip to Peru. We were informed that we would be able to buy luggage from the airline. However, it seems that we were given a basic economy flight and were not able to buy any check-in luggage in advance.Customer service was not helpful despite our willingness to pay for our luggage. We were given the option to cancel and buy or pay an extra upgrade fee of more than £2000 p/p and 'sorry' for the inconvenience.This is an advice: don't take any verbal guarantee as it may not be the truth they are telling when selling the package.We were extremely disappointed with the service before we started the trip. We will definitely come back and let everyone know how it is."
2024-05-01,N/A,Eastern Europe itinerary,This is a review for the Eastern Europe exoticca itinerary. The in-country guide was very poor and spoke little English. The organization of the tours was also disappointing and dismally boring. We didn’t experience anything interesting or off the beaten path from the run of the mill tourist sites. We haven’t had that experience with past exoticca trips but after this one we will be exploring other travel agencies.
2024-05-01,N/A,We booked a trip to Jordan and Egypt a…,VISA changes -NOTHING - no email of any help - regarding changes to visa process.Too little - too late!!!We received many emails from Exoticca- payment required - advertisements - we’ll take care of you - etc.We have run out of time.Still no help from Exoticca -No offer to rebook.Exoticca representative in Barcelona advised us to go to the embassy in person.In Canada this is a 42 hour one way drive ie a full week away driving 8 hours per day.Flying there and back is not an option flights are $2000 each.We booked a trip to Jordan and Egypt a year ago and did not hear about the changes to the visa requirements.Exoticca did not do a good job of informing us of any changes.  There are issues in the area and this has caused issues with changes in visa requirements for traveling in both directions. Exoticca did not offer any help in any way.  They would not accept rebooking for a near future date to allow enough time for us to get the required visas.Egypt consult/embassy is only located in Eastern Canada and we live in the West and are not accepting any calls or responding.They said they emailed regarding these changes and they did not.  They are not offering any assistance.  This is the price of traveling with a discount company.  Poor service - no help.
2024-04-29,N/A,Disappointment,"Firstly to let everyone know I had reached out to Excoticca so I can provide them with this feedback directly.  I wanted to have a constructive conversation to communicate what they can do better.  To date there has been no response to my request.Some background - this is my third trip with Exoticca.  I have done 2 superior categories and one Charm.Good thingsPrices are attractive.They have the nicest sales people.Hits all the main tourist spots.Bad and horribleAs mentioned previously this is my third trip, and what is very clear to me is that it doesn't matter if you book Charm or Superior all of you end up at the similar/same level hotel.  Infact in this most recent trip,  some of our colleagues who booked charm ended up in better hotels.  I also just don't understand why we were scattered all over the place and very little consistency in hotel qualities and services.Exoticca's position is that they promise between 3 and 5 stars - that is inconsequential if the rooms themselves are the worst in the hotel e.g. in the basement or the size of a closet which incidentally the guy in South Africa said should never have been rented out.We also seem to spend the first day of every city fighting to get a room that we paid for much less above and beyond expectations - it is absolutely underwhelmingIn particular in RIO there is very little communication with the guides on the next steps, who is picking you up at the airport.  Infact Exoticca Brazil kept dancing me around from their customer service, to their emergency line and then finally Exoticca US - just trying to figure out who and what time we will be picked up to go to the airport.There were alot of other issues but  for now this is what I would like to share.My purpose is to share our experiences to educate you to make your own choices as some people my not find this a big deal.  For us we paid alot of hard earned money on a yearly vacation and it left us disappointed."
2024-04-28,N/A,Title: Disappointing Experience with Exoticca's Turkey Package,"Rating: ⭐Review:My recent trip to Turkiye through Exoticca left me deeply dissatisfied. While the initial allure of affordability drew me in, the reality of the experience was far from satisfactory.Pros: Cheap pricing.Cons:Hotels: The accommodations were a major letdown. Despite booking a hotel in the so-called ""superior"" category, I found myself situated a considerable distance away from both the airport and city center. This crucial detail was buried in fine print, leading to a misleading representation of the hotel's location. Commuting to Istanbul's center from my hotel, which took an hour each way, was a daily frustration.Additionally, one of the hotels in Ankara was subpar, further contributing to the overall disappointment.Bus Journeys: The lengthy bus journeys were exhausting and uncomfortable, with travel times significantly exceeding expectations. The itinerary failed to adequately convey the arduous nature of these trips. Moreover, the bus seats were faulty, adding to the discomfort. Experiencing a breakdown en route to Ankara only added to the ordeal, forcing us to endure the heat while awaiting a replacement bus.Guide: Our guide's poor command of English and lack of substantive knowledge detracted from the experience. Instead of providing insightful commentary during visits to cultural sites like the Sulemaniye Mosque, he veered off-topic, offering trivial information about Eid festivities. His tendency to leave us to our own devices, rather than fulfilling his role as a guide, was disappointing.Commercial Activity: The inclusion of a city tour turned out to be a thinly veiled attempt at commercial promotion. Rather than immersing us in the city's cultural heritage, we were ushered into a weaving house, where aggressive sales tactics pressured us to purchase exorbitantly priced rugs. This blatant commercialism was a stark contrast to the authentic experiences we had hoped for.In summary, my experience with Exoticca's Turkey package fell far short of expectations. While affordability may have initially seemed appealing, the numerous shortcomings and disappointments overshadowed any perceived value. I urge prospective travelers to exercise caution and thoroughly research alternative options before booking with Exoticca."
2024-04-28,N/A,Do NOT use this company!!!,Do NOT use this company!!!! Non existent customer service- each person supposedly there to help passes it off to someone else. HORRIBLE experience in Brazil & Argentina!!! They are beyond the worst thing out there and turned our vacation into a complete nightmare!If I could give them less than one star I totally would!No one to help; leave you alone with no idea what to do; won’t answer phone calls; descriptions of activities and hotels are completely incorrect; in country flights they put you on are red eye and you don’t know about it until the day before you leave (making it next to impossible to re-book);these are just a few of the worst things …. I’ve never been so frustrated in my life.I met 2 others on vacation here who said the same thing about this horrendous company.
2024-04-27,N/A,Avoid Exoticca Egypt from Bristol,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!! 'Exoticca is not proper travel agent'. ALL external Flights were changed, multiple times and with huge delays, waiting in between, and cancellations. Exoticca were of no assistance, they just refer you to talk to the airline personally. I do not need a travel agent for this I could have just booked better flights myself. Changes made less than 12 hrs before departure from the UK.The flights advertised on their site do not represent the reality. 16 hrs to get from Bristol to Cairo (normally a four-hr flight) with two stops (one advertised), Cairo to Bristol 20hrs (two stops) and lost luggage as a result. I would not recommend as you are stressed when you arrive and stressed when you get home. Combined with very early starts from 3am to 5am every day.The three days onboard 'cruise' is one day cruising, two days accommodation on the boat which is docked and joined to two to four other boats, which you walk through to get on land!!! Food onboard is positively average. Only one of the advertised hotels were superior, the others were remote (taxi to any shops or restaurants) and distinctly average.Too much talking and restrictions from the guide, who was extremely knowledgeable, but did not take into consideration the guests need. No attempt to get to know our names, even though we were with him for 7 days. We were treated like high school students.Very slow and longwinded allocating rooms at destinations too.Meet and greet and collection from Cairo airport was exceptional from Planet tours."
2024-04-27,N/A,"""Treasures of Anatolia - Turkey""","The hotel choices in Istanbul is very far and inconvenient for us tourists to visit the city centre. The taxi fare from this hotel to city centre (Istanbul) is very expensive. And if you take the public transport, it would take 1.5hrs - 2hrs just to get back to the hotel from the city centre. Exoticca contracted a travel company from Turkey, Euroriente, which basically runs this trip. There were no restaurants choices for our  lunch stops. They always brought us to a ""contracted restaurant"" by Euroriente which provides no other choices for our lunch/meals. Most of the time, me and my wife don't eat lunch as there were no other option to choose from.  The optional excursions offered by Exoticca/Euroriente are very expensive compared to the on-line prices from Get your Guide. For this reason, I booked my optional excursion/activities with Get your Guide. I'm not going to recommend the "" Treasures of Anatolia - Turkey"" offered by Exoticca even though the itinerary or places to go to were good."
2024-04-26,N/A,3 South American countries  with Exoticca,"Whatever Exoticca promise on their website maybe true if all goes to plan .When you need help in a foreign country , you get NOTHING  !Left stranded at Peru airport for 12 hours to sort out onward journey to Argentina. Local guards not  great , Peru was the best of the 3 and they vary in each country .In Brazil 2 guides met us and it was late and they didn’t speak English ( not their fault , but…. Not what the website says). Nobile  hotel in Brazil at best a 2*_ Dire!Rest of the trip was fairly good but what they did to us in Peru was very irresponsible. We were the only ones at the airport to Buenos Aires: everyone else seem to know and came in later except for our tour guides who picked us up 🤦🏽‍♀️"
2024-04-24,N/A,Terrible customer service,"We wish we read all the ‘one star’ reviews before booking our trip with Exoticca.Out trip (May 20) hasn’t happened yet but we’re already deeply concerned that the trip would ever happen.First of all, the customer service is terrible. The wait time of a help line is incredibly long and they always recommend to email instead. When emailing, you need to wait up to 3 weeks before they respond. After numerous contacts by phone and email, our problem remains unresolved.Instead of enjoying the preparation for the trip, we’re feeling stressed out. It started with a wrong personal information during on-line booking back in January. It took about 2 months to fix an error by issuing a separate ticket for one of the passengers (for the additional charge of $452). However, Exoticca made another error during fixing, and another passenger information is incorrect now. Our trip is less than a month away but the error has not been corrected yet. There is a fear that one of the passengers will be rejected by the airline due to an incorrect personal information.Perhaps this review would alert future travelers to be extremely careful of using Exoticca’s service."
2024-04-23,N/A,2024 Trip to Portugal,"In March 2024, my wife and I traveled to Portugal taking a tour arranged by Exoticca Travels. While the tour was generally arranged and executed well, we had a problem during our return trip to the US. On the day of our return trip, we were dropped off by Exoticca at the Lisbon airport with less than two hours to complete the boarding process. Due to extensive lines in Lisbon airport, we were unable to reach the boarding gate in time before the gates were closed and therefore we missed our flight. This required us to rebook the tickets for our return trip at an exorbitant price. Since we had purchased Travel protection by paying the required additional charges, we tried to contact Exoticca numerous times (emphasis on “numerous”) via e-mail and the US Contact number provided (1-888-488-0592) to find out what, if anything could be done to help us regarding this matter. (Note: No other contact information was provided by Exoticca for Travel Protection claims/concerns.) Note that no matter what time or day we called no one would answer the phone. Despite our numerous requests and attempts at reaching Exoticca, they never reached out to us to discuss this matter. In fact, the letter that I wrote regarding this matter and mailed to their Corporate office in Hartford with a request for receipt confirmation was asked by Exoticca to be held at the Hartford US post office and never accepted by them.I am writing this review to alert future travelers using Exoticca to be extremely mindful of Exoticca’s total indifference to customer concerns and requests."
2024-04-22,N/A,Stay away from Exoticca - part 2,"US-EX2023177375.  We are now 7 days away from our trip to Iceland and Exoticca still has not fully resolved our situation.  On 4/17, after many, many calls to customer service, I finally spoke to Milda in customer service who explained we cannot communicate directly with FlyPlay airline.  I was told that we must select and pay for our seats and pay for carry on luggage with Exoticca.  She said we would also check in for our flight 24 hours in advance of our trip by calling Exoticca (not the airline) by calling a phone number that we would receive by email. Fine. After many, many calls to customer service we finally were told why we couldn't access our flight info on the airline's website. Finally, someone at Exoticca shared these important details with us. Milda also told me on 4/17 that my travel partner and I could each bring on board the plane one carry on luggage (fits in the overhead compartment) and a personal item (fits under the seat in front) and she sent me an email to confirm this  Today we received our final trip summary from Exoticca and it clearly says in two different places in the document that we can only bring on board a personal item and it must fit under the seat in front.  Our trip does not include carry on luggage.  So tomorrow I must start calling Exoticca again to straighten it out.  Exoticca - I know you read these reviews.  I am flying out on Sunday 4/28 and I need you to clarify this.  I need you to email me to tell me that we can each bring on board a carry on luggage that goes in the overhead compartment AND a personal item that goes under the seat in front. I need you to do this by Friday 4/26 so that we can pack for our trip.  I also would like a revised Trip Summary that deletes the language mentioned above and adds that we can each bring on board one personal item and one carry on bag.  Finally - Exoticca you said in response to my last review that you messaged me.  Exoticca - How did you ""message"" me? I did not receive an email, text or phone call from you after my last review."
2024-04-23,N/A,"disorganized, time-wasting, poor communication","This tour was quite disorganized with a lot of wasted time and lack of communication. People in the same hotel class were placed at three to four different hotels at each overnight stop. This led to us being hauled between hotels and waiting at each one for loading and unloading. The hotels were variable and often did not put us with two single beds as was confirmed on our reservation. One just had a double bed in a loft up a ladder that felt quite unsafe. One of our excursions was cancelled, but Exoticca never notified us. We found out the night before from the hotel manager. By then, it was too late to book anything else. It took over a month for Exoticca to refund our money.Our tour was of Greece and included various islands. We planned our own activities based on the published itinerary. All but one of the ferry times was inaccurate. They changed the ferry times to midday and dropped us off 2 hours early. We lost many hours when we should have been sightseeing or swimming.When I tried to contact Exoticca various times during the trip, their open hours did not match what was posted on their website. They never responded to messaging on the app. When I finally reached a person, he said that I had to go through the local tour operator. So even though Exoticca took our money, they provided no help or information. I will never travel through Exoticca again.(US-EX2023154404)"
2024-04-23,N/A,Bad experience when arrived at the Rome Airport,"I just got back from my Europe Group tour last March 2024. First off, I am 86 year old and purchased the europe trip with my friends.  As I arrived at the Rome Airport, I asked for a wheelchair assistance.  The airport staff took them 45 minutes to bring me to the baggage claim department.  As I received my luggage, exited and did not find any of my friends.  I did not find any signage from Exoticca.  No one from Exoticca greeted me.   I contacted the 800 number from Exoticca and no one answered, especially with the time difference from United States.  NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL!!!  I ended up taking the Taxi from the Airport to the Hotel and paid with my own money.  When I got to the hotel, I found out that my friends arrived in the hotel an hour or so ago.  Exoticca did not even call me at the hotel to see if I made it safely. When I came back to United States, I wrote my complaints to Exoticca 2 times on different weeks and never did receive a response back, even an acknowledgement from Exoticca would be nice but nothing from them. Bad experiences from the Greeter, Transportation Department and customer service!I never received the call. I called you yesterday and I was on hold for over an hour. Please call me back."
2024-04-21,N/A,If you’re planning to go to Guatemala…,If you’re planning to go to Guatemala tours don’t use Exoticca . It’s the worst experience that i got. No speaking English tour guide. Itinerary not being followed. No communication on what time is pick up time and where to go since it’s not in there apps. Hotels no air conditioner. Very limited breakfast food choices. Very very bad experience . I won’t recommend it. Don’t go with Exoticca tours.
2024-04-19,N/A,No seats on airplane with Basic Economy!!…,"We haven't yet taken our tour of Ireland, but I want to warn people about making flight arrangements through the Exoticca.  We booked our tour 5-6 months ago, paying the total balance of $4,000 several months ago.  We were issued our flight information and given ticket numbers.  However, it turns out that Exoticca never selected seats for us; i.e. we had NO SEATS on the plane! So, when my husband went on the airline's website, the plane was just about full, and there were no two seats together. (He has a disability and I had let Exoticca know ahead of time that he needed wheelchair service.)  They claimed that when their customers choose Basic Economy, Exoticca doesn't reserve seats for them.  They said that we could have requested they select seats for us...but admitted that they never communicated that fact. They also said if we couldn't get on the flight we paid for, they would try to locate another flight and let the group in Ireland know we'd be arriving late.  Thanks alot!"
2024-04-18,N/A,Before you book any trips with this…,"Before you book any trips with this company, try call their customer service see how long you have to wait to get though. need I say more."
2024-04-18,N/A,Bad start in Costa Rica са-EX2024223946,"Currently I am in Costa Rica the tour that we bought with Exotica, first - the tour says 10 days, but actually it's 9; from April 14 till April 22. Second - the hotel in Arenal volcano area - Eco Arenal is really chip, it's 2 star hotel, even owner said it. It's small, smelly rooms, and really bad breakfast - same food each day, no vegetables even tomatoes, cheese is processed no fresh one, one type of eggs- scrambled eggs and you could not put it on your plate yourself. No fresh baked goods like croissant and no yogurt. Tours are ok, but some of the guides do not have enough information or have bad English. My nightmare continues, I was added to another hotel that other group of people, and they are in 4 star hotel but not me. I am so disappointed."
2024-04-17,N/A,On my recent trip to Peru,"On my recent trip to Peru, their staff damaged my luggage and they have refused to replace or compensate me for the damage which I showed proof and alerted them to prior to departure on my last over night stay.  Will never travel with them again, especially since I have spent over $6,000 in travel with them.  Not worth it."
2024-04-16,N/A,Stay away from Exoticca.,"We are within 10 days of traveling to Iceland and Exoticca still has not yet corrected their error.  We have called them many times and emailed many times and they cannot figure out how to fix the problem.  Exoticca gave us a non-working PNR number and we still cannot access our flight on the airline's website.  We are unable to pay for our baggage, select a seat, and we cannot access our trip in order to check in 24 hours in advance of our flight.  Exoticca cannot figure out how to correct the problem.  Their suggested ""fix"" is that we go to Logan airport (Boston) and pay for our bags at the ticket counter, select our seats at the ticket counter and check in for the flight on the day of our flight at the ticket counter.  This is pathetic.  I will never travel with them again or recommend them to anyone else."
2024-04-15,N/A,Zero star,"Zero star. Absolute crap of a company and an ansolute nightmare of a trip. They booked the worst tickets. Basic of basic, we didn’t even have assigned seats and neither could we pay to upgrade our seats. You get no mileage for the tockets they book either.Their customer service is a joke. All on whatsapp like some scammy company that they are.Once we arrived to peru, they had scammed us once again. We booked a premium luxury private tours but they messed up our entire itinerary.Booked basic train tickets instead of vistadome. Had no guide for us at machu pichu. Then mixed up our itinerary days. Our trips were all cut short because they kept booking us basic tours instead of premium private tours that they already took the money for.By the end of it, i was just asking for the awful trip to end already so we can get home to USA.I should have read the reviews. Exoticca is an absolute scam of a company.Oh and they also promised checked bags but we kept getting plan tickets with no baggage included and paid upto $300 in fines to get our luggage through airports in peru.I will be reporting them to my bank for scamming me."
2024-04-10,N/A,We book 10 days to Greece with exotica,We book 10 days to Greece with exotica.   We paid extra and upgraded hotel rooms toSuperior But in Athens hotel was 3 stars and in Mykonos the hotel was 2 stars.  Very bad experience.I called Exoticca 5 to 6 times and was on hold for more then 2+ hours.Don’t waste your money with travel company.
2024-04-10,N/A,Absolutely the worst travel tour…,"Absolutely the worst travel tour company ever booked with. When calling Exoticca help line the wait time to speak with someone was incredibly long and when you finally got someone they couldn’t answer any questions. We did the Turkey adventure and did not realize Exoticca only acts as a contractor/broker with an in country company. In this case that company was far better than Exoticca but still had issues. Trying to get travel and in country information was very difficult. You have to wait to get an email 15-20 days prior with a help line number. When you call that number they want you to use WhatsApp to chat and each time on same chat you have to get putting in your booking number. Even then they never provided any real assistance. Our guide and bus driver from the in country tour company were good, as was the bus and most of the hotels. I would not recommend booking with Exoticca it is just too frustrating working with them. Guess you get what you pay for but in our case felt like we didn’t even get that."
2024-04-06,N/A,AVOID EXOTICCA LIKE THE PLAGUE,"I gave Exoticca a deposit of over $1800 for a trip. Weeks before the scheduled departure they canceled my reservation and refused to refund anything.Do not believe any nonsense with which they may respond. There are HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS against them listed on the Better Business Bureau site and they have a terrible rating. Trust their hundreds of complaining customers, not their paid PR representatives.P.S. Their response says they are “sorry to hear about” my cancelation when they alone are the one who canceled it! And they “remain at my disposal” by refusing to refund my money or make any attempt to satisfy my complaint. From what I read here, and the fact that hundreds of customers have complained to the Better Business Bureau, they are “sorry to hear about” many, many customers who ended up extremely unhappy for choosing Exoticca. No worries, though, because they will be “sorry to hear about” taking advantage of you too."
2024-04-05,N/A,We booked our 13 day long Peru trip,"We booked our 13 day long Peru trip, but learned that our flight ticket are basic economic which does not give us any option to buy any extra luggage. We also checked with air lines to sort things out but in vain, customer help is no help, not offering any help but keep saying you can buy at Airport, we checked with British airlines and came to know even we manage here in UK but as we have to take our luggage out at Miami, there is no guarantee as transfer time is short and places may be already full so we have to spend excessive amount of money if we do want to get our luggage back at home in UK again!!!!!"
2024-04-04,N/A,All Exoticca Tours are not Created Equal:  Beware,"Unlike our previous two trips with Exoticca, the Treasures of Sicily was a big disappointment.  In fact, if this had been my first trip with Exoticca, I would never travel with them again.  The local contracted tour company in Sicily was disorganized and chaotic; the tour was offered in 3 languages, so the English translation was somewhat limited; but what we found of greatest concern was the fact that Exoticca misrepresented and was deceptive in what was actually included in the tour.  The tour description described the many historical sites to be visited, and stated 'Included' on the travel brochure.  We were indeed driven to these various sites, but we were told by the tour guide that not a single admission fee was included in our package.  I tried contacting Exoticca Customer Service during our trip to make inquiries, but I was not provided with a response to my concerns.  Upon return home, I have contacted Exoticca Customer Service several times to try and get answers to my concerns, but again, there has been no response. This experience is so different from the other 2 trips with Exoticca, so it was a true disappointment.  I had hoped to avoid having to write a negative review, given my previous 2 very positive experiences.  Clearly, not all Exoticca tours are created equal in terms of experience."
2024-04-03,N/A,We travelled to Portugal in October and will be travelling to Jordan and Egypt,"We travelled to Portugal in October. Trip and arrangement by Exotica were satisfactory.Accordingly, we decide to take your tour to Jordan and Egypt in May. We also invited two more families to join us in this trip. But, we are very dissatisfied with the change of flight schedule. For the fourth time, Exotica decided to change our flight to Jordan. Now, flights are longer, and more stops. It is very frustrating.It is a regret that we are going to change our mind and never travel with this company again. Sorry, but it is not reasonable to change our flights four times for this upcoming trip."
2024-04-02,N/A,Customer Service don't care,"It's 4 of us in this trip. At our initial booking, the agent mispeld one of the names. Even thoulllgh we send a copy of the passports, they couldn't change it. Instead, they ask the person with the mispeld name to pay $1,700 to be in the flight.That was like half of what we paid for the trip.  Thankfully,  when I called Air Canada to choose a seat, and I asked her if she can changed the name of the person, (before this the personnel of United airlines said she'll change the name so I was relieved), but the United Airlines personnel doesn't know that she actually cannot change the name, but Air Canada knows that you can't and there's no way you can get a boarding pass. Air Canada personnel suggested that I should cancel the trip and re-book it. Thankfully,  we paid for cancellation and so we were able to re-book the trip to another day but it was $100. more because of the date. My concern was, why didn't the Customer Service of Exoticca told us the better way how to go about their mistake?Another thing, when we reached the hotel, they didn't honor our Early Check-in although we paid for it. We reached their at 8AM and didn't get in until 1pm. We also have to pay for our breakfast for $12.00 pp which should have been included with our early Check-in.  However,  Exoticca said they will refund what we paid for Early Check-in in 14 days."
2024-04-02,N/A,"Trips to Chile, Bolivia and Argentina","Six of us recently had three trips in South America that were continued one by one. The first trip was in Chile 7 days, the second in Bolivia 6 days and the third one in Argentina and Chile 11 days. We expected to have a main guide on each trip like we had in Ecuador 2 years ago (also Exotica trip) but we did not have anybody who would help us with all possible problems! There were problems with communication with Exotica offices in these countries. Most of local guides were very good except Alehandro in Santiago Chile and his driver who was driving like crazy! One moment it was 140 km/hour and we had to warn them. In Piedro Atacama hotel the staff, with very limited English, told us that we were not in their system and there are no rooms for us! Communication, by wats-up, with the exotica office in Santiago was hard to get and eventually after 45 unpleasant minutes a young lady found our names in the system! In short: it was great to see these beautiful countries but trips without guides who would be with us (like in G-adventure trips) all time I would not recommend. We will avoid to travel with Exotica again."
2024-03-30,N/A,Charging 640$ to correct Marie to Mary!,"I wrote 1 star review last week about being charged 400$ to make a minor name correction from Marie to Mary . On Monday March 25 I received a call from Lucette who told me the charge was not for a name change, but  if we opted to make a change to the final destination . She assured me there would only be a small fee for the correction . On March 29 I was informed by Lana the charge would now be 640$. They refused to let me speak to their ticketing department so we could have a conference call with Delta where I was told there is NO charge for a minor change . All our flights are on Delta and their partner Kenya Airways . Delta will not allow  me toMake the corrrection because Exoticca booked it . I have repeatedly asked the exoticca agents to change the name with Delta but to no avail ."
2024-03-30,N/A,We are back from our trip and numerous…,"We are back from our trip and numerous issued happened during our trip! First, Exoticca had the pick up time incorrect for our excursion and we waited an hour for them to get us not knowing they came and left already. It was rescheduled for the next day and yet again they arrived late, since they forgot about us! The description of the excursion, Soana Island DR is over 12 hours, nothing ever said we would be on a bus, boat, stop at a gas station for bus transfer and stop at a gift shop! Also, we had requested numerous times to have our flight changed since we had a 4 hour layover to and from Punta Cana but they refused to do this, we ended up spending 22hrs at the airport due to delays and then a rocket launch out of Florida! We have been home for almost a week and I am still waiting for a response from Exoticca!!"
2024-04-02,N/A,Exoticca Travel Fails Again,"Exoticca Travel Fails Again; Refuses to Give Me Credit for properly cancelled TripI bought their insurance and I gave them more than 30 days notice of Trip Cancellation, but they still have NOT credited me ANYTHING into my Exoticca WalletI have EMAILED them and even had a Nice Conversation with one of their Customer Service Representatives who agreed with me and assured me that it was just an oversight.  I didn't even have to wait an hour or more to talk to someone.But here I am 3 weeks later and there is still $0.00 in my Exoticca Travel WALLET.What is with this Company?I guess if you never have to change anything or if you never have a valid complaint, then they can be a worthwhile company.Unfortunately like many others, I continue to experience Hell.   PLEASE, Exoticca, just give me the almost $1,700 that is legally due me, preferably a refund so I never have to deal with you again!"
2024-03-29,N/A,I’m 50 days away from my vacation and…,"I’m 50 days away from my vacation and I’ve been stuck dealing with something so simple as a name change for months. I’ve talked to the airline and the reason I’m unable to do a name change is because I booked through a third party(Extoticca). Why are you taking payments and booking flights knowing that if there is any issue(such as I am having) you are unable to make changes without losing out on thousands of dollars? Was this in some sort of fine print or disclaimer, that we were not going to be able to make changes or fix mistakes? Now my only option is to cancel my original flight(no credit or refund) and repurchase a flight from America to Africa within 60 days of my trip. I’m very disappointed!"
2024-03-28,N/A,Exoticca response replaced no honour!,"Exoticca replaces their responses to reviews! They responded to my review on this site & said that ""our agents will contact you as soon as possible to address and resolve your claims"" on Mar 22. Today that review is gone from this site! It took until Mar 28 to receive a response, that was the same old response. There is no honour here."
2024-03-23,N/A,Feel like I’m being charged 400$ unfairly !,"60 days  prior to our trip I alerted exoticca that my traveling companion’s name was spelled Marie instead of Mary . Her middle name was not in ticket but that is NOT necessary. Exoticca told me it was going to cost 400$ to change her name from Marie to Mary. I called Delta and they told me there would be NO charge to change her name,  but alas because Exoticca made the reservation Delta support said I must contact Exoticca directly . I am hopeful Exoticca will rectify the situation and make the change with Delta free of charge as they certainly should . We still have not left for the trip . It is true that Exoticca did try to contact me by phone as stated below in their response, but their follow up email sent after the phone attempts toldme that I would need to pay $400 for the name change. I tried to contact exoticca twice by phone after their calls and the email , but the wait time was over 60 minutes . Hopefully this will be resolved and I will amend my review ."
2024-03-22,N/A,South Africa,"South Africa March 2024I would not use this company again.-They put me under alot of pressure to book.-There is no 14 days cooling off period, which is normal for the uk, as this is not a uk company, if we would have cancelled the next day we would have lost our £4000 deposit-The communication from the beginning was terrible, it was not unusual for me to be on hold for an hour, often I’d get to an hour then put the phone down. I never spoke to the same person twice.-They miss spelt one of my children’s names which then lead to him not being on our booking, we could not book seats on planes or even check in online.-I requested direct flights, they told me that was not possible (out right lie)-I requested 4* hotels we stayed in 3 hotels & all where 3*-Also requested swimming pools in the hotels as we have children, one hotel had a pool but we was only there one night, there was other pool at one hotel but it was so small it was like a bath, it was abit of a joke to be honest.-individual excursions where brilliant, well organised & our guides & transfers where great. This was all down with an external company called ‘Amazon Africa’ I would definitely use them again.-South Africa is an amazing country & well worth the visit, the food is unreal, the service, people, culture, wildlife unforgettable but I would not use Exoticca again."
2024-03-21,N/A,"Once they have your deposit, you are at their whim","Our flights were cancelled. Spent weeks trying to get a response as to when they would contact us to rebook. No one could tell us when that would happen. It took weeks. Then we were away when they finally did get back to us, and confirmed our flights anyway without waiting for us to confirm. You would think after we waited for weeks, they could wait for us, not nope! Would not have booked those flights or the trip. Once they have your money, you are at their mercy. Now we get a few hours of sleep, if we are lucky, before we start our very active trip. Not impressed. The only response I ever got to when I would hear back was when I posted a review here & they responded that someone was working on it."
2024-03-21,N/A,TRIP TO ITALY,"My wife and I Booked a trip to Italy for travel from May 9, 2024 for 9 days. On February 16th I was notified by Turkish Airlines that the flight times have changed for flight from Washington to Istanbul and return time as well had changed. I called Turkish Airlines to see if I needed to do anything. They told me only Exoticca can confirm the change or cancel the tickets.I have called 4-5 times in the last one month Exoticca Customer Service and nothing has been done as of today. They keep on saying they will escalate the matter to the office who will confirm the tickets but very disappointed as the matter still is unresolved. Extremely poor customer service.I wanted to do seat selection on Turkish Airlines but cannot do anything unless the TICKETS ARE CONFIRMED BY EXOTICCA FIRST.I wish I had not used Exoticca for this trip. I have already paid full money.WHO FROM EXOTICCA CAN HELP WITH THIS, BY CANCELLING THE ENTIRE TRIP AND NEED MY MONEY BACK?"
2024-03-20,N/A,Talking to customer service is like…,Talking to customer service is like talking to jello
2024-03-20,N/A,Terrible experience !,"Went on one good trip with exoticca to Greece, so I thought I'd book a second trip. This time to Panama. It was the worst trip I'd ever taken. They put us in some two star resort full of locals and under construction. Noisy, dirty, messy and this happened after they verified we'd be at a certain hotel. Then, they changed our hotel to this dump. Exoticca reps didn't care or bother carrying about my concerns. My family and I were genuinely afraid for our safety. Terrible experience. Don't be fooled by the low prices. There customer service is by far the worst in the industry."
2024-03-20,N/A,Ecuador is on the US do not travel…,"Ecuador is on the US do not travel list, and have themselves declared a ""state of emergency"" in January. Google it to confirm yourselves.Exoticca would not allow a postponement, only a cancellation. (I tried four different times and was told they would not do it) The trip included over two full days of ""explore on your own"" in Ecuador. Are we supposed to hide in the hotel those days to avoid murder and kidnapping?For a cancellation, they keep the full deposit, $3,199 in this case. Don't give them the chance to rip you off too. US-EX2023177826"
2024-03-19,N/A,Tour guide very difficult to understand,We had a local guide for three days 5hat was great. For the other six days our guide was nice but……his accent was so strong we only understood 15% of what he said. So frustrating to be in front of a church or attraction and have no clue what he is explaining. He was friendly and would make a great guide for a Spanish group. Our van was rather cramped as well.
2024-03-18,N/A,very hard to contact,"very hard to contact,  There is no long distance number to connect. I pay bill for long distance. Very inconvenient. I am wondering how the tripe will be. Disappointing."
2024-04-02,N/A,Be vigilant when you book,"The earlier you book with exoticca, the worse the flight schedules are. I would advise checking your flight details with exoticca before booking. If you want to know more, read further.The following is only related to holidays which have additional flights within the package exoticca tries to sell to you.The problem is you do not get your domestic  flight schedules until some time after you have booked and paid a significant amount towards your holiday. By then you are locked in to their terms and conditions which basically say no refunds.Exoticca provides the information  about your flights to and from your destination during the booking process, but be aware that your flight will not include hold luggage; it is stated on the booking site, but is easily missed.It seems that exoticca books the cheapest possible class of ticket which often means that you have to pay extra for luggage, even on long haul flights. Also, because they are the cheapest class you have no option to upgrade with the airline. Exoticca do not tell you this.We, for example, were booked on 2 flights from Lima to Quito via Bogata, yes Bogata. Departing Lima at 11.25, arriving Quito 20.35, including a 4 hour wait at Bogata departure lounge. Lima to Bogata 3 hours 20 mins, Bogata to Quito1 1 hour 35 mins. We left our hotel in Lima at 7.30 am and arrived at our hotel in Quito at 22.15. A whole day wasted and this weariness impacted our follwing day too.Exoticca were completely intransigent and declined all entreaties to book us on another flight to fly direct to Quito from Lima.Fellow passengers, most of whom, booked much later, were flown directly to Quito on a 2 hour flight and enjoyed almost a full day in Quito. They reported that there were several seats free on their flight.No amount of interaction with Exoticca makes any difference. Flights direct to Lima were still available with other airlines on our day of departure.We were told, during our interactions with exoticca, that flights were booked automatically, and that they could not change them because of airline policies! When we asked to escalate our concerns to senior managers, we received the following answer.""Regarding your request to escalate this matter to a senior manager, we regret to inform you that, due to the nature of our policies and limitations, we are unable to escalate this case further. However, please rest assured that your feedback will be shared with our team for internal review and consideration for future improvements"".Exoticca, when reading this, please do not send me a private message to ""reach out to me"" so that you can go through the sham of implying that you do your very best for your customers. You have squandered the opportunity to put things right for the sake of a few measly dollars to your profit line.Addendum.You may see from Exoticca's reply that there is a gulf between what a traveller would label as reasonable and what exoticca describes as normal.This is another ""fudge"" answer and does nothing to address the issue of escalation. There is also another fudge in terms of identification of passengers for data protection. Exoticca knows exactly who I am.The whole booking process is not as transparent as exoticca would have you believe from their reply.I have now edited my review score downwards as exoticca have not taken the opportunity to amend their customer interaction policies. Exoticca continues to insist that the interest of the customer is at the heart of their business. I do not believe this to be the case.Make up your own minds. You have been warned."
2024-03-17,N/A,Don't go with Exoticca!,"Everything went wrong! Our hotel in Istanbul is almost an hour's taxi ride and $40+US from hotel to city center! Our itinerary was totally messed up, tour dates and hotel dates were mixed up, 2400 kms on a bus, forced shopping stops, mandatory tips of $40.US is questionable as to who gets it (guide says he gets $7. and driver gets $3. and the ""office"" gets the rest! I could go on..."

2024-03-20,N/A,POOR CUSTOMER CARE TEAM,"I had issues on my original booking where I had logged a complaint with feedback. This was failed to be addressed to a satisfactory resolution. I received a response on 23rd January.I have since responded to the company on the 25th January, 8th February, 23rd February and today 16th March where I am being completely ignored.No After Care, no customer care, Jane from the company has no customer care skills.Rookie company - avoid as if you have an issue they will not support or resolve and leave you ignored. Would not take the risk.I have had to raise a complaint with ABTA to seek resolution.**EXOTICCA REPLY BELOW has stated an agent is in touch - however since the 23rd January they have ignored my communications since 23rd January despite  sending emails on the thread they advised on the 25th January, 8th February, 23rd February and today 16th March**UPDATED 20/03/2024Despite the below reply no one from EXOTICCA has tried to contact me since 23rd Jan. they have not called or email even including spam folders. Complete liars and avoiding dealing with a complaint!!!Please call me!!!!If you have any issues good luck in resolving them."
2024-03-14,N/A,No confirmation/reservation,My husband and I booked & paid in full for a trip to Greece including flight and several excursions. We received an email confirmation for our flight through Turkish Airline. We wanted to upgrade our flight and when we called the airline they did not have a reservation for us. My husband tried calling Exoticca customer service to inquire about the issue. He was on HOLD FOR 2.5 hrs WITH NO ANSWER OR RESPOSNE!!!! We leave March 31st and are panicking. Please someone from Exoticca reach out to us ASAP!
2024-03-14,N/A,Just bought our first and last tour…,"Just bought our first and last tour with this company. When I paid initial deposit they told me customer service could help me with seat selection for flights and they would transfer me. They transferred me and a recording said the wait was over an hour and they would call back within 24 hours. No call back yet, way outside of 24 hours. Also emailed them twice two days ago with zero response. It’s true what another reviewer wrote-that they are impossible to reach unless you are buying a new tour. Zero faith in this tour company. I suspect many positive reviews are fraudulent. Note that the positive reviews are “invited” (ostensibly by Exoticca)."
2024-03-14,N/A,Worst Customer Service,"Make sure you read the fine print, especially the cancellation policy!  Once you send them money, there is no cancelations or changes that they will allow and if you have to make any changes you lose all the money.  When I booked our trip, I accidently picked the wrong dates.  When my wife realized it an hour after booking, I contacted Exoticca and asked if we can change to the other date - they responded with ""no changes are allowed once booked"".  Even though it was only an hour after booking and we were not asking for the money back, they would not even consider working with us for a different date.  Then when it came to booking our airfare, what we originally picked for a flight they changed to (I am sure to save them money) to a flight that required a 7+ hour layover.  There are literally dozens and dozens of flights from Atlanta to NY, but they would not put us on one that would reduce the amount of time we had to sit in the NY airport.  The customer service is the worst and they do not care about you once they get your money.  Do NOT use them!"
2024-03-14,N/A,Urgent Attention Needed,"Urgent Attention Needed - Booking Issue for Upcoming Trip to IrelandDear Exoticca Customer Service,I am writing to address a critical issue with my upcoming trip to Ireland, scheduled for departure on April 30th.My original request involved linking my booking with my friend's so we could travel together. Unfortunately, we received separate flight itineraries: mine departing from Baltimore and my friend's departing from Washington D.C. Additionally, my flight appears to be routed through Ireland instead of a direct flight to Dublin like my friend's.Furthermore, my booking does not include any checked baggage, and I have been informed of a $120 one-way fee.I have attempted to reach customer service through email on multiple occasions but haven't received a response.Given the proximity of my travel date and the significant inconvenience caused by this situation, I kindly request your urgent assistance in:Linking our bookings to ensure we travel together.Clarifying the baggage situation and exploring potential solutions.I have been a loyal customer, having taken 3 trips with Exoticca in the last 9 months. I would appreciate a swift resolution to ensure a smooth travel experience for myself and my friend. I wish you would do more to retain loyal customers like me.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely,"
2024-03-14,N/A,Cant even book a trip …,I can't get ahold of anyone in customer service. The site won't let you fill out a contact form. When I fill it out it won't process without a booking#. Yet I don't have a booking # b/c I can't make a reservation. The dates of the flights are a day after the daily itinerary starta. Very confusing. I can't even book a trip because if the confusion and misinformation the tours are showing online
2024-03-13,N/A,Stranded on an Island,"I was extremely disappointed with Exoticca because our 7 day trip to Italy consisted of 2 days of travel in Naples and 5 days in Ischia. While I was initially excited about going to Ischia, I didn’t realize that nothing was open. Most restaurants, hotels, tours, operating boats were closed. No one informed me of this and we were literally stranded on this island with nothing to do. Apparently everything opens April through October and it is primarily a summer resort area. I was even charged with a boat tour to Capri which did not exist. However after I bitterly complained, they refunded my money. You cannot reach any customer service representatives by phone so process of getting answers is not very fast. The tours in Naples were just okay and one of them we did not even take because it was raining so hard and it was a walking tour. We also had difficulty with hotel manager. All in all it was a waste of time and money. Our travel was also set up very poorly with no means to change!"
2024-03-12,N/A,Exotica ruined our honeymoon,"Pretty furious with Exotica and feel like they have ripped us off. We upgraded the hotel package to ‘Superior’ at a substantial cost. They switched hotel that is advertised to a much lower quality option. The advertised price per night of this hotel is about half that of the one advertised. Exotica have pocketed the difference.We thought this would be the case before we came away, but now we are here, it is worse than we imagined. It is impossible to speak to anyone at Exotica. We tried numerous times before we came on holiday and to give up after half an hour on hold.I emailed to complain, and the (eventual) response was a clear fob off. I don’t think they even read it properly.I’ve never left a bad review in my life, and wouldn’t, if Exotica responded with an acceptable response. Book your holiday with anyone else!"
2024-03-11,N/A,We have used Exoticca for two trips and…,"We have used Exoticca for two trips and have another one booked for May.  We were very happy with the  service, but we booked another trip on a Saturday afternoon.  On Sunday we realized that we had a wedding that we needed to attend during the time of the trip.  We called and were told to call Monday.  We called on Monday and waited over an hour on hold.  We wanted to change the date, but they told us that we had to cancel the trip and rebook. We lost the payment we had made of almost $1600, so we never rebooked and we will never use Exoticca again!"
2024-03-11,N/A,I have tried calling them six times and…,I have tried calling them six times and get hung up on through the automated system every time even after being on hold for an hour and half. Finally went through a booking agent and her put me on hold in the same system again. Horrible customer service and all I want to do is pay for my trip. I will not book through them ever again.
2024-03-11,N/A,Impossible to contact,"Booked a 2 week holiday to Costa Rica in August 2024.  The original flight had a 2 hour & 4 hour stopover outbound & inbound.  We have received an email from the airline on the 26th February advising us that the flights have changed & the stop over is now 23 hours & 19 hours & to contact travel agent if not acceptable.  Since this date we have tried numerous times a day to call.We have also tried to use the system where Exoticca call you back within 24 hours, we have filled in online forms & sent a message via Facebook Messenger and we have still not had any contact.  I really don't know where to turn to sort this matter out.  Clearly now they have out money, customer service has gone out of the window."
2024-03-11,N/A,Impossible to contact the company,"We have a holiday booked with you to Costa Rica in August and our flights have changed & we now have a 23 hour stop over outbound & 19 hours inbound (2 & 4 hours on original booking).Since the 26th February 2024 & despite numerous daily attempts, we have been unable to contact anybody by phone or email, Facebook messenger, online form.  We have tried every option on the phone & nothing.  Got a reply on Facebook messenger saying they will contact us, that was days ago, nothing.  We can see people have left reviews on here for the very same reason. I just feel this company take your money then nothing.  So incredibly annoyed and dread to think of the support if you need assistance in resort!!!"
2024-03-10,N/A,First time to purchase trip package…,"First time to purchase trip package with Exoticca. Very disappointed. The ground team/organizer at the destination demonstrated careless to their guest than making money. The local team picked up only two people and left me and other four guests in the hotel on the first full day tour in Istanbul. They charged 10% fee to all credit car payments by falsely claimed that was the fee for credit card. On the last day, the van driver woke me and other guests at 3:30am, one hour before the scheduled time (4:30am) to transport guests to airport. that'd disrupted guest's limited sleep and ruined my pre-arranged breakfast with the hotel. Despite the poor service performance, Exoticca asks every guest to pay a $50 tip for the tour!  I filed a complaint once I came back from my trip with the travel agency, Exoticca only agreed to give a small booking credit but refused to address other problems by making either excuses or putting false narratives. So I will have to escalate the matter to protect my interests as a consumer. Therefore, I am not recommended this service at all."
2024-03-08,N/A,Future trip,We have a holiday booked with to Norway in July.Unable to contact anybody by phone or email!!! We leave messages and no respons!Is this a legitimate company!!Very frustrated customer!!!
2024-03-08,N/A,nobody responds to emails or phone calls,"our flights were changed which means we miss 2 days of our trip. All was booked through exotica. I've emailed, no response. I've waited on hold for almost 2 hours to speak to someone to get a resolution. I was told the flight department would get back to me. When can I expect that, I asked. The response was no idea. That was over a week ago.I was going to book more trips, but not now with exotica & thankfully I waited to see how this one would go.I have no idea what is happening with my trip for which I paid a deposit.I still get multiple emails trying to sell me more trips, but no response to my queries."
2024-03-06,N/A,We are traveling to Rome from Boston…,"We are traveling to Rome from Boston (tomm) and were notified less than 24 hours that our flight has been canceled. Upon doing some research, we learned that Luthansa (sp?) is on strike. Thus, our flight into Frankfurt is curtailed. We have  been on hold for over two hours, to be told ""we are working on it."" I do not feel a sense of urgency on their part to remedy the situation. Passengers/customers have made plans for travel. The inability to communicate with Exotica to get a definitive answer, when we are flying in less than 24 hours is unfathomable. Particularly, when they deem themselves ""superior."""
2024-03-06,N/A,We are set to leave in two weeks to…,"I have responded to my email thread numerous times and it takes days to get an answer and still no phone call to discuss this situation! My review is complete disappointment on Exoticca’s behalf and lack of communication and help with our reservations. Again, the flight we are switched to has a 4 hour layover both ways and you refuse to help!We are set to leave in two weeks to Punta Cana with Exoticca and we are already disappointed! This wasn’t our original trip, we had to cancel our Italy trip due to the unexpected death of our travel companion. We picked our flights and room type, now our flights changed to flights with 4 hour layovers to and from Punta Cana. I have contacted American Airlines and they informed me I can change my flight but I need Exoticca to change it, well they won’t unless I buy a completely new ticket and loose our current payment! Then our room has been booked with two double beds instead of a king and now I’m being told they only have twins and double beds available and I can deal with it at the resort!! Really what did I use this company for if I am making changes at the resort myself??"
2024-03-05,N/A,Customer Service Inadequate,I need to kindly request the management team to look in to changing Exoticca customer support in UK.I requested to upgrade my hotel in Istanbul by email to customers@……….in February. I got the confirmation of hotels last week and noticed it was not changed to a town centre hotel.Trying to contact anyone has been a disgrace as -1. Customer service hours are Mon-Fri from 9-6pm when most people are at work (service needed weekends and evenings)2. Wait time on phone is > 60mins so your number is registered but no-one calls back within 24 hours - tried this on a number of days (I was not using my mobile for a couple of days whilst waiting for Exoticca to call!)3. Took a day off to sort this out by phone but phone would cut out after 20minutes saying everyone is busyI have now been told I am too late to upgrade to hotel near town even though I had emailed to ask for the change back in February but no-one responded and I could not get through on the phone. The holiday is still 2 weeks away.I have also booked another holiday in China for which I asked about details for one of the excursions before booking - was told to google the trip. There are many routes on this excursion so wanted to know which route the excursion was taking  - how would google help? Where are your China experts to advise customers??My first experience with Exoticca has not been pleasant and the holiday hasn’t even started! Your customer service response needs to change.
2024-03-04,N/A,Vietnam,"Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand trip with Exoticca had some high points and definitely low points.Accomodations are adequate or subpar. Of the hotels on this trip we had a green pool that can't be used, no restaurant for dinner, mold in the bathroom. The last hotel in Bangkok was in Chinatown on a poorly lit street with sex workers outside the door, no restaurant for supper and again was in Chinatown so ironically, I couldn't find Thai food near my hotel in Bagkok.This trip did not have consistent guides, we had new guides regularly so no relationship was developed. Excursions overstated the experiences. I reached out to Exoticca to let them know the experience as this was my 3rd trip with them and I thought they would value my ongoing business. I book 2-3 trips a year, Exoticca has been 1 of them for the last 3 years. They offered me a $70 credit voucher which 1) feels rather insulting on a $4000 trip and 2) they did not actually apply to my account. When I told them I was upset and hurt by what I took as a reflection of their value of me as a customer, they increased it to $110 which also was not applied to my account. It's not even a refund, just a credit on future travel. Why would I want to book with them in the future?The trips are cheap, but understand you do not have any control over your flights, and most of the excursions are optional, so you do have choice, but they make up for the overall cost through the excursion pricing.I enjoyed Morocco and South Africa with them. I have encouraged others to use them. This trip saw some really interesting things, and had some really unfortunate parts, which I would have been okay with, had customer service responded in a way that felt respectful."
2024-03-04,N/A,Good Tour guide,Booking the trip was easy. But contacting them via email/text/ WhatsApp is not there. No one responds to your emailOur flight got canceled and no one from Exotica contacted us and we found out when we tried to check in.Getting them rebook was not easy. If your flight gets cancelled last minute you are at their mercy because they are your travel agent. I fought with Airlines to get a flight otherwise my trip would have been a washout.Planet tours was the local operator for Exotica. The trip itinerary was entirely up to guides discretion. Mina(male) our guide was terrible. It was just a job for him and didn’t care for anyone and he is very unprofessional.Didn’t give us proper time at any of the sites. Either it's 30 or 60 minutes. he didn’t have problem waiting  as long as you wanted when they take us to these shopping trips.Egypt: Giza Pyramid 30minMake sure you ask for a good tour guide Your total experience of the trip depends on them.Ask for emergency contact numbers.
2024-03-03,N/A,BE AWARE and STAY AWAY,BE AWARE and STAY AWAY!   Exoticca ruined our Thailand vacation. This is a scam travel agent that takes your money and offers luxury accommodations. Our hotels were less than US standard Motel 6. Once we arrived in Krabu and Phuket we did meet any tour guides to assist with travel. No English speaking guide was available. We checked out of their prepaid hotel package and booked stay at another hotel. Hotel looked like US fugitives were hiding out!   Scary people and filth rooms. This travel agency should be investigated for taking people’s money. Shameful and disgraceful thieves work for this company. We were unable to make contact with representatives after arriving Thailand.
2024-03-01,N/A,Shoddy-Customer Service after Booking with Exotica,"We have booked a trip to Turkey and Greece for Sept 2024 with Exotica. Our first and likely last!We wanted to book our day excursions and make a change to our inbound flight. Calling Exotica Customer service is absolutely of no use as you will be on hold for hours. It seems after they book you initially their customer service ends.We initially tried to contact Exotica on Feb 8,2023 and were told that they are very busy and we should enter a form.As per their phone prompts, we were asked to enter our issues on a form at Exotica.com-contact. We did so on Feb 23 and received a reference number 02875811 and were advised that someone will contact us within 5 business days. To date no one has bothered to contact us as we wait patiently.Sent a reminder and again no response from Exotica.We are at our wits end with such shoddy serviceBrian"
2024-04-22,N/A,"3 requests for an answer, no reply","I've sent 3-YES THREE- requests for a response to an issue I have with our flight connection for Vancouver to Tokyo.  The Exoticca ""travel agents"" have chosen a flight that gives us 1 hour & 12 minutes which is beyond stupid.  WE WILL MOST CERTAINLY MISS THIS FLIGHT & I want to know how it can be changed.  I am not going to race through a huge airport on the extremely slim chance that we'll get to our plane.  I want an answer to this.  Terrible customer service.  We had the same no-reply issue when we used this company for our trip to Greece.  Never again!the booking # is CA-EX2023171479"
2024-02-29,N/A,No 24/7 support and no compassion,"I was considering booking a last-minute trip through Exoticca, but before doing so I had some questions so called. I'm very comfortable booking online, I just wanted to speak to someone about promotions, the premiumcare offered, visas, vaccines, etc. Once I said what trip I was interested it was all about choosing the airport/flights and selecting excursions. While excursions could be added later, I was told the could fill up so best I book them now.  I had to interrupt to ask my questions.  As I am American, I was told I should check visas myself, the rep only knew requirements for UK. As far as vaccines, she said malaria was a risk but I would need to speak to doctor for recommendations.  Clearly, I had not looked into either of these, but then she was asking for my credit card. The priority was very clearly get the money, get it booked.  I was caught up in the excitement of one last holiday before I become a mother.  In hindsight, I wish I had waited so I could check both visas and vaccines, but it was 5pm on a Friday. Not sure if Exoticca has a 24-hold option (most airlines do) but it was not offered to me, even though she knew I hadn't undertaken the checks that Exoticca recommended. She was pushing for the booking so I booked.  Well, as you can guess, I started looking at the travel vaccine recommendations and found that travel to malaria risk areas are a no-go for pregnant women. On Saturday (less than 24-hours), I rang the 24/7 hours customer support number listed on their website, but the recording stated office hours Mon-Fri. The money hadn't even left my bank account yet. I filled in the customer support forms online and rang first thing Monday morning to cancel and ask what could be done. Some sympathy for my situation, but under their T&C's, I would not qualify for a refund of my deposit. There are no exceptions, none, no one to elevate the situation. Fastest £618 I have every lost.  Clearly Exoticca is in the business of making money and compassion is not factor in... not when they have T&C's to fall back on.  So you decide who you want to give you business to."
2024-03-19,N/A,Where should I start,"Where should I start. I didn’t really want to leave a bad review. I tried a few times to send something what I didn’t like about the last trip in Guatemala, and every time the answer was: we like you enjoy the trip🤔, and can you leave a review? So I’m doing it right now.Arrival at the airport someone supposed to wait for us. Actually I wait for them. Half an hour later someone came like nothing happened, no English at all( I guess they expect to pickup potatoes). The hotels, I can understand their standards are different, no coffee machine or a kettle in the room, that’s ok, but at least in the lobby. One day I asked at the reception when it’s the pick up the following day , she said 7 am. Did the luggage went in the lobby, the receptionist said : I made a mistake, it’s 7 pm. Ok, at least can I have a coffee? The answer was the breakfast start later, so no coffee.One day we supposed to visit Guatemala City. Was promised either at the beginning or the end of the trip. Never happened , so I missed seeing the capital.I’m not a picky eater, but the breakfast was terrible.A lot of other things not worth mentioning.Overall the worst trip with Exoticca ( and I took 8 ). From the first to the last everything went downhill. I guess they became popular and not paying attention to quality anymore.I got another email from Exoticca saying that after my review they want to know what they can do to improve, so it’s more than obvious they didn’t read the review. It’s a shame, used to be a good company. I suggested it to many friends, now I’m going to let them know what’s really happening and never book with them. Still no response from Exoticca to my review what shows how much they are interested in their customers"
2024-02-28,N/A,Beware of Exoticca and their Flex Cancelation policy,Beware of Exoticca and their Flex policy for cancelation. We bought that policy for a trip we planned over a year in advance (because we're in our 70s and a lot can change in a year.) When we had to cancel our trip we were charged $450 despite having the Flex policy. That $450 is a deductible that is not mentioned in their description. They tried to convince me that was a good deal because if I hadn't had the Flex policy I would have lost ALL my deposit. Quite deceiving. Just beware.
2024-02-28,N/A,I was on hold for one hour 30 minutes…,I was on hold for one hour 30 minutes and two days later have not received a confirmation email or confirmation in the Exoticca app of my excursion purchase.  I regret ever booking with Exoticca and have great trepidation about the upcoming trip with the abyssmal customer service.
2024-02-28,N/A,Bait & Switch - Hotel Scam,"Exottica markets hotels with pictures then reserves the right to change the pictured hotel, by listing other hotels below it as possible alternative accommodations.  The reality is they are not ""possibly"" going to change the hotel, they fully intend to change the hotel.  It will be the most ""cost effective"" option available to them.  In my recent case, they ""pictured"" the Kempinski then waited 30 days before the trip to change it to the Crown Plaza.  It is a marketing deception where they retain the right to change the pictured hotel, but the reality is they will change it to whatever is most cost effective for them no matter which category you choose (basic, mid, luxury).  I requested adjustment to a  comparable hotel and they refused to change it, insisting that the Crown Plaza meets a comparable standard to a Kempinski hotel, though I paid for the ""luxury"" category. It is not difficult to prove that the Crown Plaza is not comparable to a Kempinski in either price, amenities, or general appearance.There appears to be a pattern with Exoticca, where changes are consistently made to the hotel or flights within 45 days of the trip. Their insurance only covers you if you cancel a certain amount of days prior to the leave date.  In both my experiences, the hotel was never adjusted until after the insurance expired. This is my second trip with Exoticca and the second time my primary hotel was changed just before the trip.  Last year, it was done 2 weeks before the trip. They will tell you they cannot make changes, but clearly, they can make changes at the last minute.  I did not receive a formal notification or valid explanation as to why the hotel replacement occurred until after their refusal to make adjustment to the hotel. Of course, after I complained about never receiving one.I will never travel with this company again."
2024-03-04,N/A,Be Careful!,"My husband and I booked a trip toEgypt with Exoticca.  When the war broke out we no longer felt comfortable traveling near that region.  I contacted Exoticca asking to change our trip to the Galapogos Islands, which was advertised on the website. This was over 4 months before the scheduled trip. I said I was willing to pay the difference for the trip, and the cancellation fee. It was my understanding I could cancel 60 days before the trip. The answer was no change, no refund.  I was shocked!!  I lost over $3000.00.  They showed no compassion or concern.  I would never work with this company again.  It was a horrible and frustrating experience."
2024-02-27,N/A,No customer service,"Costa Rica departure 25th Jan by BA via Miami.(would have gone direct to San Nose but this was not offered)BA flight to Miami had a technical problem and after 4 hours on the A380 the flight was cancelled and we were disgorged into T5 and abandoned with 465 other passengers.Tried calling Exotica to resolve but nobody answered.After 2 hours managed to get a BA customer service person who eventually managed to reroute us with. Irvin via New York and Aviance via Guatemala to San Jose.36 hours later we arrived in San Jose and despite my emails and phone messages we were not given any info but just taken to the Barcelo Hotel in San Jose.I contacted the local rep and was told that we would be picked up at 6.15 the following morning to be transported to our next destination.Ghe coach arrived and stopped at 10 other pick ups and waited for 30 minutes by the side of the road for some lost luggage before we were on our way.We arrived at Tortuguero late afternoon had.A quick swim and supper.Next morning after a 2 hour canal trip in torrential rain we departed for our next destination,Arenal,and we arrived late afternoon.So by thistle we had spent 4 days travelling.Next day we trudged up the volcano in the rain and saw nothing.Day 6 visited the sloths and the hot pools which we enjoyed!Day 7 Coach and boat to Monte Verde.Grey and overcast and a very long and tortuous journey.Day 8 Hanging bridges in the rain.Blowing a gale for 2 days and our charm hotel had nowhere to sit outside when the sun came out.Day 10 Mong coach journey to Tamarindo3 days at a very nice hotel and we actually saw some wildlife!Day 13 All day coach journey tonSan JoseDay 14 Flight home via Miami.Day 15 Arrive London Heathrow exhausted!My thoughts on Exotica?Nobody takes ‘ownership’ of your trip.The whole organisation appears to be haphazard.The members of our party had all come to Costa Rica by different routes and ended up staying at different hotels.The pick up times for people on the same trips never coincided and I had to call the local rep to confirm arrangements.So basically Exotica book everything upfront using local companies and then you’re on your own.You could get lucky and everything goes to plan but if there is any disruption you’re in your own!Incidentally we had 2 meals en route to and from Tortuguero at the supposedly charming city of Guapiles which turned out to be a roadside cafe not noted for its exotic surroundings!We are very experienced travellers having been all over the world and always made our own arrangements.Having experienced Exotica I think that maybe that’s easier!"
2024-02-24,N/A,I’m reading all of these fantastic…,"I’m reading all of these fantastic reviews, and wondering who are all these people?  I booked a trip to Peru, a week ago, and cannot get answers to many questions whether it’s through phone or email.  You wait over a hour trying to get through to someone, unless of course you booking a trip, then the phone  is answered in moments . Once you book the trip it’s like you’re on your own,I don’t even know what type of trip I’m going to have now  between the so called 4 star hotels, transportation etc.  I’m a savy and well seasoned traveler and I have NEVER experienced anything like the customer service.  I feel like cancelling my trip but I now realize I won’t see a penny of it even though I paid for extra insurance. I’m actually not looking forward to trip now. So disappointing This is just crazy."
2024-02-23,N/A,Exoticca Tours -Their Travel Agents/Customer Service sucks,"Exoticca Tours: They are located in Spain. Their travel agents/customer service sucks.  They will keep calling till you book.  After that, they don't care.  Also, they would lie to your face, without doing their due diligence.  I wanted to book from Newark, NJ, since I live in NJ & it is nearer to my place of residence, and was told that they don't have any flights from Newark.  On checking, I found there are flights out of Newark (Turkish), the same airlines operating from Newark as well as JFK.  They also said that they would provide two free nights in Bangkok to unwind, on checking their detailed itinerary, discovered they have charged for the same.  If you call them and dial the extension for new bookings, someone will pick up immediately, but if you dial for service, no one picks up even after waiting for 4 hours.  Twice left a message for the person (Florencia) who made the initial booking,  still no response. Instead, I received an email to pay the balance amount!  Sucks.  I don't know whether I will get my initial deposit back.  Their refund policy sucks. I feel, the US government should not allow them to operate in this country.  I hate people who are liars.  I am not going to consider them in future travels & for the general public to be cautious.  Beware, be extra careful with Travel Agencies located outside of US.Reference #8638482 and the Agent's name is Florencia Giordano.  Our conversation seems to be recorded and the same could be reviewed by the Management."
2024-02-22,N/A,No response,We've booked a trip to Costa Rica in May. I cannot get any response from anyone with regards to questions I have. Multiple emails and phone call ignored for the past 2 weeks. Beginning to think I've made a very costly mistake booking with this company.
2024-02-25,N/A,Customer service non-existent - only excuses to cover their tracks,"PLEASE READ THIS....this may be deleted.  Exoticca continues to get traffic based on low priced packages. People like to join 'no brainer' tours where hotels and transfers are done. Only a few people talk about the problems - flights with 6 hour layovers and 2 city hops when this could be easier. Customer service always says ""I will escalate this to management"" but this never happens. My husband was not able to travel - I am out $1800 - not able to roll over any of the funds for future travel, could not even change the name for travelling companion. There is ZERO response from Exoticca - so how does this make me ever want to travel with this company again????????????"
2024-02-22,N/A,Customer service non-existent,"Customer service when you are having difficulties while travelling is non-existent.Although their pricing is very reasonable I caution potential clients to be prepared for a switch in accommodations. They do not necessarily book a group into a hotel they advertise on a particular package - essentially, they bait and switch.They are never keen on cash refunds, they offer a small credit on your account to be used on subsequent bookings with a time limit.They don't follow their statements about customer satisfaction. They dig their heels in the sand and won't budge, which also puts their travel agents in a bind.To provide additional information for the benefit of Exoticca, as requested:My package was Mekong Treasures covering Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos & Thailand between Jan 20 - Feb 7, 2024.I believe that Ibis Styles Silom Bangkok does not compare to Holiday Inn Silom Bangkok, although Ibis Styles is a modern budget brand of Accor Hotel Group. The hotel rooms, and bathroom, which are the basis of my complaint, are very small, in comparison to Holiday Inn or other 4-star properties in the Silom area/district of Bangkok.  This was brought to the attention of Exoticca  3 weeks before departing( was advised that the hotel booking could not be changed, and if I was unsatisfied to bring the matter up with the local travel agent or Exoticca's Customer Service. I immediately contacted the local agent by telephone upon entering the room after checking in at the hotel to make my displeasure known. The travel provider had hands tied by Exoticca to provide alternate accommodation. The only ""solution"" presented was to pay the cost of the booking at Ibis Styles and pay the cost of the alternate hotel.  I might add that the hotel booking at Ibis Styles rather than Holiday Inn (as listed as a Superior Category) that we were led to believe was being booked) was made in October shortly after I booked the package and paid 50% upfront, by the travel provider; However, I was not informed of the switch until the end of December. If I had been informed when the hotel booking was confirmed I could have cancelled the booking, without penalty. The Exoticca app showed that Holiday Inn was confirmed as booked until I could access my Travel Summary.I have vowed not to travel with Exoticca again, and urge other travellers considering booking to exercise Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware).Exoticca has not apologized or taken responsibility reneging on their own commitments and terms and conditions."
2024-02-20,N/A,Do not book Exoticca,"I have been trying to get a hold of exoticca.com for over two weeks now to make my final payment. I have sent emails, phone calls.. the recording said that my number would be registered and they would call me back in 24 hours and still no one has returned My email or calls!!!!   I just made a phone call and after one hour and 20 minutes on hold waiting for someone to pick up… I hung up. I would recommend not using Exoticca for your travel!!! go to one of the other Tours companies.. who knows what’s going to happen with my booking now. They may retaliate against me for telling the truth, how unorganized, and how they have no customer service whatsoever."
2024-02-20,N/A,Tried getting a price for a trip…,Tried getting a price for a trip online-got as far as entering my phone number then backed out! only to have an agent directly call my phone number about a trip! I did not give him permission to call and sale me a trip! Sketchy……. I just booked some where else!
2024-02-20,N/A,Bad experience,Right from the start of the trip we had issues. My name was spelled incorrectly and I almost could not go on the trip. 1.5 hrs were spent between air Transat and Exoticca to straightened out this issueVery stressful. Our first hotel we asked for two beds and they put us in a room. With a double bed. We I formed the hotel we could not be on the 2nd floor.we were placed on the 2nd floor and had to carry our luggage up to the 2nd floor in 3 hotels.we spent at least 3 days in the bus going back and forth and lost those days from our holiday. Got to a resort and the people we were with were at a different hotel 1 mile away. One of the excursions the time to leave was changed. Our friends had to walk to our hotel at 830 pm approx 1 mile away to tell us the time was changed. Willcontinue this review later
2024-02-19,N/A,Bad first impressions...,"I've been trying to get ahold of exoticca for weeks now after booking.  When I went to call about making a new booking someone always answers right away but after you make the booking nobody answers.  I have called and called and done the call back options and wrote on the form on their website and still have yet to get a response.  I'm now past the due date for payment but my questions and concerns are about how to pay.  Its super annoying that you can book with a credit card but the rest of the payments have to be done via bank transfer.  I don't care for this and it seems sketchy to me since I've never done that before.  At first, I could pay in installments and now they want the entire payment up front.  This all seems so sketchy to me and I wish I wouldn't have booked with them.  But they don't do cancellations it seems which is also weird.  I just want to speak to someone about it as well as visas and currency and flight times.  When booking, our flights also didn't make sense about when the tour actually starts.  I finally called the new booking option again and someone answered right away then refused to help me and just transferred me again to the same department that never answers.  I was on hold the other day for 90 minutes and then they hung up on me.  I truly don't know what to do at this point.  Just wish they would actually call me back because the recordings all say they will within 24 hours and I have yet to get a call.  In my opinion book with a different company."
2024-02-21,N/A,Customer Service Wait Time Awful,"My return flight was canceled and I needed to reach Exoticca customer service.  I called the minute they opened and the message said it would be an estimated hour wait.  It is my understanding that if you call later, it can be much longer.I am writing this while I am waiting on the phone for them to answer.I finally reached someone after an hour and 20 minutes and they took care of my issue.  But my return flight is still not listed on Delta, the original flight company.  They said it was canceled by my travel company.  It is only listed on Air France.  Which makes me nervous if I have an issue."
2024-02-18,N/A,Worst travel experience ever and I…,"Worst travel experience ever and I haven't even gone on the  trip yet. Their customer service is the worst ever. Do yourself a favour, just book flights, accommodation and excursions yourself. It will be quicker, less stressful and probably no more expensive."
2024-02-18,N/A,I wish Exoticca would respond to my…,I wish Exoticca would respond to my emails as quickly as they respond to a negative review.7 days later - and our final payment is due tomorrow - and I still can't get any help.  Exoticca hides behind their wall of responding only to emails and still hasn't fixed our flights.  Customer Service only works Monday through Friday!What a dreadful company.  Wish I'd never heard of them.
2024-02-16,N/A,flights,I loved the exotica iceland tour with a great guide  Beggi! however I did not like that I could not pick my seats and check in for my flights myself. I was given  bad information about it  .And i waited on hold for over 3 hours twice to only be told i cannot do  it but only Exotica can. I was told to go through the airline  and the exoticca rep had given wrong information!  I was very unhappy that we had to pay for our carry on on the way back and hopefully will get reimbursed.
2024-02-16,N/A,The nightmare with Exoticca just goes…,"The nightmare with Exoticca just goes on and on.  We booked a trip for 4 to Kenya 8 months ago to ensure we could grab the airline seats we wanted.Four days ago, I discovered on my own that Air France had changed our flights, giving us a 35 minute layover in CDG.  I started calling Exoticca at 9am on Monday.  I left my phone number, I emailed and I texted.  I was on hold for 84 minutes when I received telling me that they were too busy and Goodbye.  Well guess what, I'm busy too.It wasn't until I posted about my troubles on Facebook that I received a return call, 26 hours after I left my phone number.Exoticca knew of these short connections in January, but hadn't bothered to do anything about it until I finally was able to speak with someone.  Not only had Exoticca not notified us, but their rep Julia was fighting with me that 35 minutes was a perfectly reasonable amount of time to change planes in Paris!  Even the Air France rep said the connection time was ""insufficient"".After another 92 minutes on hold, a customer service (an oxymoron if ever I heard one) rep now tells me that nothing further has been done, despite the issue having been escalated to Critical.  It's now past Critical - it's on life support!I work 12-hour shifts in an ICU and I don't have time to step away from a patient to deal with this nonsense.I am so sorry I ever heard of Exoticca and just want someone at Exoticca to fix the flights.  I'm tired of beating my head against their wall."
2024-02-16,N/A,BE CAREFUL WHEN BOOKING,"BE CAREFUL WHEN BOOKINGReview of ExoticcaPending reviewBE CAREFUL when booking!! 10 day trips turn to 7 depending on the flights. On my booked trip I will miss a whole free day of exploring Rome because their itinerary leaves out pertinent information when booking! Example, we lost a whole day and 19 hours in flight. You are only informed of flight times on booking. Without doing your own research, you will not see how times align. My arrival to Rome airport will be at 11:00 pm. By the time I go through customs and get to hotel I would imagine it would be close to 1:00 AM on day 3! We will then have to check into hotel, eat breakfast and meet tour guide at 8:30 am. When I became aware of this time, Exoticca said they would have to cancel my reservation and rebook with a 75% penalty fee! All I needed was to move my flight earlier so I would not lose a whole day. Now, I am petrified of what else they have in store for us on arrival for our March 2024 Trip!My airline will allow changes up-to 15 days before travel.  However, Exoticca will not.  It would virtually cost exoticca nothing for me to change my flight to a day earlier and I book an extra night in hotel to get some sleep. I see they responded to my review, but i am unable to respond back.  Yes, flight suggestions were listed but time differences and even dates upon arrival were not!  With no date listed for arrival, one would assume it is still March 10.  Flight choices only show how long flight is and departure date, not date and time on arrival at the destination."
2024-02-15,N/A,Agency didn't make any efforts to see for our safe food,"Agency didn't make any efforts to see we had safe food or good resterants. some hotels only server breakfast and after that we were expected to eat on the streets with dead rats, open sewers at our feet and extream traffic within a few feet."
2024-02-15,N/A,NONEXISTANT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"NONEXISTANT CUSTOMER SERVICEI called Exoticca last Monday 2/12/24.   I waited on hold with Customer Service for 92 minutes. Then a recording comes on and states that you have exceeded the hold limit, and disconnects the call. Then I sent Exoticca a request for a call on their website. Although it is now 72 hours later, I never received a call back. I also filled out a contact request by email last Monday as well, but again there has been no response. I have a payment due, which they state must be done by bank transfer, that I would like to discuss with them. Any traveler would hesitate to proceed on an International trip with a company that is totally unresponsive to their customers."
2024-02-20,N/A,No Refund No credit,"My trip was cancelled without notification . My wallet was stolen. l notified my bank of the incident . My bank put a temporary hold on my account.l also told my bank that my purchase with Exoticca was an authorized charge made by myself and they went ahead and approved the transaction . However Exoticca refuse to reinstate the trip and basically said that I am losing my deposit so they keep my money and I get nothing. It was undue to any fault of my own. At least Exotica should’ve notified me of any payment issues prior to cancelling my trip. After numerous phone calls and various emails all I would like would just to be credited I would love to take a trip with Exoticca but to get nothing in return, it just doesn’t seem fair, especially since it was no fault of my own.My booking reference wasEX2024226980 . All l would like is for my trip to be ￼ reinstated, or at least receive a credit for future travel. Exoticca got the money from me and now they refuse to at least give me a credit for future travel .l could understand if l cancelled or made changes willingly but l didn’t they have no empathy at all . what kind of business does that ?"
2024-02-14,N/A,I booked and paid Azores trip on Jan…,"I booked and paid Azores trip on Jan 30, 2024.  Last week I added an activity on Feb 8 and asked the Representative from call centre if I can use the credit from my Exoticca wallet to pay this New added activity, he spoke to his supervisor and told me that I could use the $50 credit to pay this added activity and he could charge the remaining balance $83 from my ViSA which I approved to go ahead.  I contacted the customer support to follow up since I had not seen the credit applied.  I told them that the conversation was recorded by Exoticca call centre on Feb 8 from 2:14 pm - 3:00 pm and I asked them to honour the verbal agreement. Now Julie from the customer support denied this verbal agreement and wrote me the below to threaten to cancel my activity if I don’t pay,  see below email reply:“ We apologise for the misunderstanding from our team, however, is mentioned that, unfortunately, the $50 wallet can only be applied for future bookings.Please complete the payment belowOtherwise, we will have to cancel the additional excursion”.JuliaCustomer SuccessExoticcaIt is really unreasonable as the conversation was taped and verbal agreement is an agreement. Not was their error and not mine.  Why am I being punished,  Horrible"
2024-02-15,N/A,"Do not use Exoticca, non-existing customer service","Booked week long Italy through Exoticca. They are a consolidator who will sell packages offered through local travel agencies. I had several items go wrong and the only thing exoticca would say is that I’m sorry, we are looking into it. Nothing else.1) the Italy company (Mastergroup) is woefully understaffed. The accompanying guide was calling to locate a city guide or arrange things, which were constantly changing at the last minute. It was confusing to have one time to meet and then it changed, a common occurrence.  Chaotic2) tour guide lacked compassion and dedication to customer. I sent a detailed description of actions to exoticca after the second day with the group. I received a form letter email and nothing else from exoticca. They do not stand by the tours they offer.  It is a hand off to the local agency for you to figure out3) We had a medical emergency (severe vomiting). We could not get assistance and were left on our own to obtain medicine, sustenance, etc. we asked guide to rearrange schedule so that we could experience included and prepaid tours. She said she would check with the company. We heard nothing further. When able we proceeded on our own.  We did not receive a prepaid portion of the tour. It was off season and plenty of tickets were available.4) flights. The flights are basic economy. No seat selection or bags are offered. Our flight was delayed and we would have missed connection. The airline only offered flights arriving the following day, three days into the exoticca itinerary. Again, we were left on our own and I figured out a way to join the group.5) hotel selection. While the hotels appeared nice inside, they were very thin walled. You could hear every toilet flush and conversation.6) hotel rude. Our Florence hotel (NilHotel) was extremely rude. As a smaller group, the second morning we entered the breakfast area, gathered some food, and sat down. A waitress said that we had to move downstairs to another room. Take our plates and go!  The hotel was within a walled compound with retractable metal shutters on the windows. It did not feel safe to leave. The final issue was being overcharged at the on-site restaurant. My bill was more than what the other part of our group was charged for the same dinner. I sent this information to exoticca. The only reply was that they were in receipt of my comments.7) included walking tours. At the Florence and Vienna stops the walking tours continually changed times. They were late in the day, which limits how much you can explore on your own. Very inconvenient.Overall, exoticca will sell a package and leave you on your own. Two different inquiries and nothing has been done about it.  If you are savvy and want a reliable experience, bypass Exoticca and book direct. Exoticca will not be there to help you.  Book at your own risk. I was the travel and contingency coordinator throughout.  It was not relaxing.Update: I submitted a post travel review, third attempt to discuss, directly to exoticca. Interesting that the only way that I can receive a prompt response is through a public forum."
2024-02-14,N/A,Customer service is horrible,"Customer service is horrible.  Trip itself was inexpensive but so far customer service, trying to reach a live person for help and when I do, he is rude and hangs up on me.  Confusing and difficult to read itinerary."
2024-02-14,N/A,Bank transfer for a final payment; slow and unhelpful customer service,"Exoticca  changed final payment to “bank transfer” without any previous notification. This proved quite difficult to do with my bank, and I found it a complete hassle. I wasted a lot of time having to do this. I had also contacted customer service by email to verify an ACH could not be used, and did not hear back for seven days (heard today). The answer was totally unhelpful."
2024-02-14,N/A,Early payment anxiety,"It appears you made a big deal about getting my final payment in ASAP, which cost me a lot of time and expense, when it wasn't due until July 12th.  I hope you are better at delivering a fun trip experience."
2024-02-13,N/A,Room issues,We are dissatisfied with the hotels and rooms chosen especially when given that we chose the superior package. The rooms are small and we should have booked the rooms ourselves .
2024-02-13,N/A,Booked to go to peru ecuador amazon…,Booked to go to peru ecuador amazon galapogos Island but the day after we booked civil unrest happened and fdco said essential travel only to ecuador.So we asked just to go peru again asked for our deposit back which they wouldn't do asked if we could go to a different rep all together or keep it as credit but they wouldn't help.They said pay the rest over £10000 and if they cancel they may be able to get some of the money back but if there are still problems and we cancel at the time of the holiday we would not get anything back.  Travel insurance does not cover us if you do against fdco guidelines. We lost our deposit they were not helpful at all had no other suggestions they just wanted the money. I have contacted ABTA.
2024-02-13,N/A,I purchased a Guatemala package on…,"I purchased a Guatemala package on 12-27-23. Talked to Walter in Barcelona. He clearly told me that I needed to put down 60%, which equals to $898.80. When I received email confirmation, I realized he charged me the whole amount of $1498.00. I called the very next day, 12-28-23 and talked to Vita.  She said that management had to listen to the recording and would get back to me and it wouldn't take long. I haven't heard from them ever since."
2024-02-12,N/A,The trip overall is not good,The trip overall is not good. The toilet is in the bush. Everyday is on the bus instead of flying. It took a lot of time. The road is very bad and bumpy. There is not much things to see. The hotel has no air conditioning. Don't recommend to anyone to visit Madagascar and will not buy the tour from Exotica anymore because of bad services and not worthy with the money.
2024-02-13,N/A,Payment method,Just tried to make a final payment for our trip in April. Dismayed to find that the only option for payment on line is by bank transfer. We phoned as we preferred a credit card option. While this was possible the sales assistant said that if we did a bank transfer they would reduce the payment by £50. This feels highly unethical given that companies are not allowed to charge more for credit card payments. We still opted for a credit card payment for peace of mind should there be any issues with the booking. However this will make us think twice before booking again with Exoticca. Do not wish to give our booking ref. and personal contact details on this public review but will pass these details on to you for you to investigate if you provide me with an email contact.
2024-02-10,N/A,MISREPRESENTATION/LIED TO,"MISREPRESENTATION/LIED TO: Was informed on 1.24.24 by Walter upon putting deposit to Portugal that we can pay the final via credit card. But when final payment was due - there was no other option to pay but via bank transfer. Despite over 6 attempts including emails and call and replies (including one reply to Exoticca's"" payment overdue and may cancel"" ) - no call back, no emails. on BBB, travelers had deposits forfeited because of non-payment on the due dates. With NO RESPONSE from Exoticca and MISREPRESENTATION , this company is acting fraudulently.  Reviewers stated that Exoticca will change their flights and demand for more $$.  We had emailed them asking for confirmation that flights were confirmed and evidence of proof of flights booked - again NO RESPONSE.  We want to cancel and have our deposit refunded."
2024-02-10,N/A,Poor customer service,The sales representative misled us when we were booking our trip.  He said one thing but didnt includein final price.  We were not able to see final bill untilafter we paid the deposit.Calling customer service is a waste of time you are on hold for over an hour and then get discounted.Writing a e mail doesnt get all the facts a waste of timeh
2024-02-10,N/A,"Terrible service, no communication","We have booked our trip to Peru and since paying our deposit the service has been dreadful. My emails have gone unanswered, the phone line just rings and no one picks up, we have tried to use the online form to elicit a response, but yet again have heard nothing. It really doesn’t fill me with any hope that the trip will go smoothly. Our outbound flight changed, which meant I had to take an extra day off work. After confirming which new flight we would take, I have asked about upgrades and how it will affect our first day at the destination as we will now arrive very early in the morning. The silence has been overwhelming. Please get back to me, this is supposed to be a dream trip and I am seriously considering canceling and going asking for a full refund due to the terrible service we have received."

2024-02-09,N/A,Worst After-Sales Customer Service in…,"Worst After-Sales Customer Service in the industry.They are interested in selling you the tour only.When you try to reach customer service, no one comes to the phone - after the sale is done.I have been on hold for more than 30 mins numerous times.They have not replied to the messages I sent them via their website.The tour aspect is Okay."
2024-02-10,N/A,"When i was booking a holiday over the…long wait on phone, rude and impatient agents","When i was booking a holiday over the phone and wanted to use my gift voucher and wallet credit, the agent could only use the gift voucher, and refused to use my wallet credit, which put me off.I had to pay deposit of £412, so he used £250 for gift voucher but could not use wallet credit for the rest so i ended up laying with my bank card.I had enough in the wallet to pay for the holiday, but he said he did not have access to it.I had to pay £162.60 from my bank card because the agent could not use any of my wallet credit he said.And he said he could not use the wallet credit to pay for the holiday, so i rang customer services, and explained this to them, after which the customer service staff(different from booking agents)Lucinette helped me to use my wallet credit to pay for the holiday.But i am still disappointed about the fact that i had to pay £162.60 with bank card. Because i wanted to pay that 162.60 also from my wallet, but booking agent(sun)said that he could not do that.So even though, i have paid the rest with wallet credit, i m not happy about the booking agent services. Because it was inconvenient to call again and speak to the customer service staff."

2024-02-11,N/A,Trip to Morocco- hope it gets resolved,"Trip to Morocco upcoming in March- as an update, I want to say that there was no misunderstanding with the booking process… I just feel that Exoticca does a bait and switch to get you to book your trip and then leave you hanging and not follow through with what they have promised. I am now downgrading my review to one star. I have not taken my trip yet but just getting it booked correctly and getting what was promised to me has been a major challenge to put it mildly and so far it has not gone well.  I booked online because I could not get ahold of anyone after trying more than 20 times and being on hold for over 90 minutes only to get cut off because they are so overloaded with calls!  The agent with whom I had been emailing promised me a free excursion if I booked before the end of January, which I did, specifically to get the free excursion.  After I booked, I finally got ahold of the agent the following day who then proceeds to tell me that the free excursion is only if I booked on the phone with him, not online!  But nowhere in the email did it stipulate that, which I told him.  He encouraged me to call customer service to try to work it out, but of course no one EVER answers the phone!  Finally after 5 days I get a nice customer service agent on the phone who was very nice and helpful and he told me that it looked like the excursion was approved and that he would request that the excursion that I signed up for be credited since I had not paid the balance due yet and that someone would get back to me.  I also had submitted several messages through the website, only to get someone in customer service telling me that they listened to the phone calls and that there was no promise of a free excursion even though I said it was an email!!!!!  Regardless, this should be honored.  Addtionally, the first payment on my CC went through successfully, however for the final payment they want BANK TRANSFER!  I need to pay through my CC to get trip insurance!  I really hope that this gets resolved and that the trip ends up being great and going off without problems, but after reading other reviews, I am beginning to doubt it.  I only gave this a 2 star instead of 1 star because of the nice customer service rep I talked to on the phone......Just beware of this company and their strange policies and that they do not deliver on promised ""free excursions""!"
2024-02-09,N/A,Your customer service hardly answers…,"Your customer service hardly answers the phones , customer service after booking is zero"
2024-02-09,N/A,Very disappointed...after booking my…,"Very disappointed...after booking my safari tours, I can't connect to any agent to assist me on gettting a visa for Kenya. I called customer service almost everyday and only I hear is the put on hold music. I will never booked a tours with exotica again and never I will recommend to anyone."
2024-02-09,N/A,Always have great difficulty contacting…,Always have great difficulty contacting exoticca by phone. Over an hour this time then gave up.   Also very unhappy that they are making it difficult to use a credit card for payments.
2024-02-09,N/A,called customer service no,"called customer service no. and once again (after 4 attempts) no one answered, even after 40 minutes...unacceptable.also have not received the credit for referring someone."

2024-02-08,N/A,BAD Communication ethics,It’s very difficult to contact anybody about payment and customer Service. I had been on hold for almost an hour and still No response.  I’m really frustrated and disappointed.
2024-02-08,N/A,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. Impossible to reach anyone unless you want to book a trip. Very concerning that they request additional payments to be done by bank transfer rather than credit card. We have tried all day to reach a rep to cancel. Thankfully, we only put the initial deposit down."
2024-02-08,N/A,Will never use Exoticca again,"Will never use Exoticca again. Just returned from a trip to Argentina and had too many issues to mention! There was very little support, all contact was via the app or WhatsApp which we were not expecting. When things went wrong it was almost impossible to get hold of anyone and we had to keep chasing them. There was no information from them, and it was very stressful. They also booked us on some awful flights. On one journey we took off and landed 4 times. Really poor company .In relation to your request for more information, I made a complaint to your company so you will have all the details."
2024-02-09,N/A,Loved the online description of the…,"Loved the online description of the India Tour, but they were unable to manage a simple 'flight class upgrade' despite 4 phone calls to seek guidance. I never received a call back in 10 days so I still have no idea why it was so difficult..The flights were available on the Airlines website...Ho humIn response to Exoticas query below:BUDGET NUMBER 8294103 for a Palaces & Deserts of Rajasthan tour to include:2 AdultsDeparture Airport LHRHotel Accommodation - SuperiorDeparture Date 02/12/2024 (approx. +/- 7 days)Direct FlightsDeparture Times LHR – 18.00 +/- 2 hours (eg BA & 18.35 or Virgin 18.05)Flight Class – Club or Business as availableLuggage – 1x Checked, 2xHandExtra Nights in Delhi – 3Extras - Early Check-in in DelhiExtras - Full-Day Delhi TemplesAll I wanted was the flight upgraded to Business from the offered inclusive EconomyWas it that difficult - if it was no one returned my calls....."
2024-02-07,N/A,Person who helped me to new booking did…,Person who helped me to new booking did not handle properly intentionally or not.He charged more than I should (600.00 US Dollas}
2024-02-07,N/A,I was mislead by Exoticca,"I am at the beginning of my trip with Exoticca. First the name of the hotel was printed incorrectly, the tour operator name for operation in Indonesia was not provided only phone number for what's up which was not reachable. I was placed in the wrong category of hotels. I have paid for superior and I was placed in a hotel which looks like 2 stars. I was trying to contact with customer service for hours to receive some help. This is not acceptable"
2024-02-06,N/A,Waiting time for phone calls was…,"Waiting time for phone calls was definitely too long. From 1/2 hr to 1hr 19 min.Very disappointed, I booked my trip and was told there were only 2 seats and right the next day when my final payment was due  the exact same trip, same dates was $100. less and nothing was done to when I made exotica aware of this situation."
2024-02-06,N/A,Disappointed,"This company does not answer calls and yet they advertise that they are available 24/7.  They will only answer calls for new bookings because they want your business but when you are booked, good luck if you can still reach them.  Also after initial deposit where you pay with credit card, they want your next payment to be made via bank wire transfer.  Very disappointed with this company  I will not book with them again."
2024-02-06,N/A,your cancellation process is ridiculous…,your cancellation process is ridiculous and your payment by bank transfer is BS. This will be my 5th trip with Exoticca and my last.you have definitely gone down hill.
2024-02-06,N/A,"Add-on charges w Exxotica - plus Wire Xfer fees, no CC?","I signed up for $2299—Epic Argentina, Chile & Patagonia adventure w/flights. Of course, the actual price I am going to pay is $5,644. Always the extras with Exxotica - this time some Argentine Tango dinner. That drops you one star.Then I pay a 20% deposit - with my credit card. Within a month, a 40% partial payment of the balance is due.  Expecting a 2nd credit card payment, I had to search your website. I finally gave up and your agents informed me I must pay by wire transfer! You must realize this gives me no miles for using my Airline associated CC, nor does it offer me any ability to dispute any unauthorized charges from you the vendor, plus...My bank charges ME for an international wire transfer. So essentially you are having a customer pay for your business' overhead! So that would have dropped 3 more stars except luckily I reached an agent who allowed me to pay by credit card. So you got a star back thanks to him."
2024-02-06,N/A,I waited in the phone for an eternity…,"I waited in the phone for an eternity to figure out how to access my Exoticca points. Each time I have called this company, I’ve been waited on hold for long periods of time."
2024-02-06,N/A,Payment issues,Exoticca insisted that I pay the balance of the payment by e transfer.  I was unable and uncomfortable with this method of payment. Unable to get clear instructions on how to go about this. Agent continued to insist.  Finally I insisted that I would pay with credit card.  This went on for 3 days.  Very stressful.  Probably won't deal with Exoticca again.
2024-02-06,N/A,Not flexibile on Hotel extra nights,"Added two extra nights, tried to cancel hotel so I could book my own closer to city. But after several calls waiting up to 1 hour on hold, was told cancelling the hotel room for two nights was not possible because I was only 41 days in advance, not 60 days. Then charge appeared on my account. Charge was removed after another email."
2024-02-06,N/A,Exotica stopped taking credit cards…,Exotica stopped taking credit cards through the email link. I then spent 5 hours on the phone trying to make a credit card payment. I would reach a human and they would say they were not authorized. They would give me another number to call and I would wait and wait. This happened individually to three of us traveling together.
2024-02-06,N/A,Non existent customer service,Non existent customer service. This is my 3rdtrip with exoticca but will not book anymore. No Service no flexibility and they don'tfollow up on what they  they promise. It is impossible to reach anybody in customer service
2024-02-06,N/A,Unfortunately a promotion  of $ 300…,Unfortunately a promotion  of $ 300 which as given to me to be used by 31 Jan 2024 could not not be honoured by the company.  How can I book another vacation within a week when I had just booked my trip to Norway  just a few days before the “gift” was given to me.  I have booked a trip to Ecuador in May. A gift of 300 dollars is “peanuts” to a company your size. I will be looking for other tour operators in my next bookings
2024-02-10,N/A,No response,"I asked Exoticca (...@exoticca.com) 6 days ago for information related to tours of Spain. At the end of October 2024 7-9 days, one-way ticket arranged by us, ending 2-3 of November 2024. So far no response.PS 8 Feb 24 My inquiry was sent to bookus Till now no response has been received.10 Feb 24 Yes, a person from Exoticca who responded to me on 30 Jan 24 gave me an email address to bookus... Nothing else. Bookus... has not responded to me yet."
2024-02-12,N/A,"UPDATE - No compassion,  just greed","Subsequent to this review, I have been issued with a credit from Exoticca.  This is what should have happened long ago.I had a wallet credit of over £2000 from a holiday i had to cancel because of work commitments.   So when I found myself having to cancel another holiday within 24 hours of booking it, (actually less than 3 hours), I was not given the opportunity to create a new wallet for a future booking.  All my money was taken ......."
2024-02-06,N/A,Credit cards for initial payment only and then a bank account account,"You take a credit card for the initial payment, and then no more credit cards are allowed. I have to use a bank account and wire the money to you. The directions on this are not clear at all, I am going to need human interaction."
2024-02-06,N/A,since you went to bank transfers i will…,since you went to bank transfers i will not book with you again. I have travel insurance on my CC
2024-02-08,N/A,Flight booked incorrectly,Follow through. Exoticca flight booked basic not main cabin. No upgrades or seat assignments allowed even for a fee. No option during booking to verify which class flight would be booked in. Called within 3 hours of booking to have it corrected. 3 phone calls and 3 promises to have our flights corrected but didn’t do it. No response for 7 days. Now trying to charge me triple the cost found on the airlines website to fix the flight
2024-02-06,N/A,So disappointed,"Be very careful if you book using the app. If you already have an account, the system will assume that the same people who travelled with Exoticca previously are the ones who are traveling each time and their system does not allow you the option to change passenger information! After pressing continue, assuming it would ask me to add passenger info, it went directly to “Thank you for your purchase” (trip is 10 months out). I immediately IMed and emailed to ask them to fix the error. When I didn’t hear back within 24 hours, I called. After waiting 2 1/2 hours on hold, I was told that the only way they could fix the incorrect passenger issue was for me to cancel my original reservation, forfeiting the down payment of $598 as well as a previous trip credit of $250 and then rebooking. Really? Their system defaults, causing a huge penalty for the customer and there is nothing they can do to make it right? They say that I can’t prove that it was their system, but every reach out is acknowledged and time-stamped. They even fielded calls and provided email info to the friend I was trying to book with. The paper trail proves the intended travelers. A reasonable customer service department would find a way to fix this, but not Exoticca. The decision-makers (leaders) hide behind the people answering the phones, who have no flexibility or autonomy to be able to help customers. Supervisors will not speak to customers by phone. Someone should be able to correct this when it was caught immediately. I’m SO disappointed in Exoticca, but would be happy to amend this review if they decide to make it right."
2024-02-06,N/A,Don't like to pay balance via wire…,"Don't like to pay balance via wire transfer, I end up paying wire transfer fees 0f $25.00 on each balance.I need to to look for other company for my future travels."
2024-02-06,N/A,Don’t book with this company!,"Previously booked trip and the country was in crisis, with violence braking out in area tour was visiting. Company did not refund but forced customers to travel to dangerous area or rebook another trip with them but take a loss in the insurance purchased. I have booked with Viking in the pass and had a similar situation and they did not charge a loss to customer! This company has been unprofessional through out this experience. My first and last with them!!"
2024-02-06,N/A,Concern on trip itinerary and customer service,"I am very disappointed at the responsiveness of the customer service. I have encountered some discrepancy between the trip itinerary I have received after booking and the web introduction on an included tour. When reached out to customer service by phone multiple times, none of my calls were answered after more than 1 hour waiting. Online request was replied 10 days after I submitted the request. It didn’t provide correction or accommodation. I am worried about the supporting service going forward especially during the trip. Hope this issue can be addressed immediately and improvement can be made soon."
2024-02-06,N/A,It doesn't work at all,"It doesn't work at all. I have a booking issue this time, looks after charged money; there is nobody to take care of the business.  It is the third time I have purchased the trip with Exottica, and this time it was a horrible and frustrating experience, It wasn't like this before. The website is just a place to attract people to pay for the business but no service at all."
2024-02-06,N/A,We could not get in touch with anyone…,We could not get in touch with anyone from your company to discuss our trip. We called more than 5 times and asked for a call back and never got a response. We have no confidence that your company will deliver the services.
2024-02-06,N/A,Crazy would be the best way to describe…,"Crazy would be the best way to describe booking a tour. I booked online, made the deposit and then was requested to pay cash via my bank for the balance. Limited directions were provided and I waited on-hold for 1.5 hours to speak with someone that could not help me. I then submitted 2 emails, however, none have been returned so far and that was over a week ago. Exotica is lucky my travel agent stepped in to save the reservation or I would have continued with my bank to reverse the charges on the deposit. The price was good and my agent calmed me down. And we have not even been on the trip yet. If you can book using a third party, you will be less frustrated. If you are going at it on your own, good luck getting questions answered."
2024-02-06,N/A,Cannot reach a customer service rep…,Cannot reach a customer service rep after purchase
2024-02-06,N/A,Phone and Payment Hell,"On hold for well over an hour every time I called. Also, I want to make a full payment on my Peru trip but your so call default only have me paying with your Bank Transfer. I want to pay off my balance using my travel card. As of December 29th it looks like you made making payments worse. Please change."
2024-02-06,N/A,Terrible customer service …,I have never done a group tour before so a bit anxious of how it works. I paid my deposit & when my next installment I paid it while vacationing in Hawaii. The next day I get an unfriendly note saying my account was overdue. I checked my credit card & noticed it wasn’t posted so attempted to call. I never got off hold. Since then I have emailed at least 8 times & asked for a phone call but nothing. I’ve called over & over but can’t get through. I paid the second installment but never get anything back saying thank you for your payment. Very frustrating.
2024-02-06,N/A,Missing trip deposit,"We booked our trip. Paid our down payment. Made our second payment of $1,744 nearly two weeks ago an it has yet to be credited to our trip. I spoke with customer service and was told to e-mail the info with bank statements so they could credit our trip. It’s been two days and still no credit."
2024-02-06,N/A,Payment method bait and switch,"After I reserved online with my credit card, I received an email stating that the rest of the payments needed to be wired to their bank! There was no warning or disclaimer when I made the reservation about this form of payment. I’ve tried email and phone call and I cant get a hold of anyone."
2024-02-06,N/A,I am your loyalty customer and refered…,"I am your loyalty customer and refered dozen of new customer to your  site and booked packages.  However, I do not receive appropriate referring credit and the credit cannot use to my own booked trips. When I listed person I referred to uou the new customer received credit but exclude me. I have three more trip to go on 2024 two of the trips still have balance waiting to pay. Hope I can use my account existing $200 credit to pay coming trip balances."
2024-02-06,N/A,It was very frustrating to make my…,"It was very frustrating to make my second payment!!  They had no trouble taking my credit card to book the trip but when I tried to make the second instalment I couldn’t pay online.  The first time I called I hung up after 30 mins.  The second time it took 45 mins!!  I suspect the wait time would have been much less if I was booking!  When I finally spoke to an agent, however, she was very nice."
2024-02-06,N/A,Multiple Failure to Respond,"I have tried calling multiple times.  Each time I am placed on hold in excess of 30 minutes each time.  Twice I have left a number for a call back and as yet, no call.  Very disappointing"
2024-02-06,N/A,The website does not allow you to pay =…,The website does not allow you to pay = it really needs fixingIf the payment issue is due to the card networks not allowing access from the Exoticca site I am now suspicious that Exoticca is a sham or amateur company
2024-02-06,N/A,The agency booked the wrong airport for my trip and refused to help fix it. Now I have to drive an hour away instead of just 15 minutes away.,"I asked to fly from LAX to Europe. The agent accidentally booked me for another airport, which is an hour away from me instead of just 15 minutes. when I called and asked for their help, they refused to change or fix anything. Every time I called I had to be on hold for an hour. This is unacceptable."
2024-02-06,N/A,Incompetency,"We booked a trip to Italy on January 26th, the next day Exoticca acknowledged that they have booked our names incorrectly. They have asked for copies of our passports to rectify the situation but we have had nothing but run around since. February 2nd Exoticca has the audacity to ask for more payment when they have shown incompetency to fix the present problem which was not caused by us. We are asking Exoticca to refund our deposit in full and to cancel the trip if they are not able or willing to correct their error."
2024-02-06,N/A,Took three phone calls and numerous…,Took three phone calls and numerous emails to solve my issue.
2024-02-06,N/A,Payment option issue.,This was my third booking with Exoticca. The issue I had this time around was that they wouldn't let me pay with a credit card when it was advertised on the website that you can pay via credit card. I had to make several calls for them to let me pay in the most convenient way for me.
2024-02-06,N/A,Go Elsewhere!,I would not recommend using this company.  We have a trip coming up this week and I have hit brick walls every time I have asked for something.  They are not customer oriented whatsoever.  Use someone else!
2024-02-06,N/A,Can not get through phone,Can not get through phone. Waiting on the phone for long for customer service.

2024-02-07,N/A,Kruger to Cape Town nighmare,"We are currently on the Kruger to Cape Town tour Jan30 Feb 8 2024 .The Kruger part was exceptional with the tour guide Hubert and accomodations although the afternoon could be shortened , it seems we drive aimlessly around because the safari company insists they stay until 3pm,At cape town we had no travel guide support at all.They put us at the Cape Diamond hotel in a very unsafe part of the city.One tour member had cockroaches , they checked an elderly couple into a room and when they went to the room someone was in bed!Another couple had no booking.In our room, the deadbolt would not unlock, and we were trappped , they was no contact #  ( update 3 days later still no contact number)to call the front desk , i pounded, kicked and yelled for 45 minutes and finally the deadbolt gave away.The next morning fellow guests advised me the called the front desk but no one came to assist.The hotel is rated one star.If you care about your safety do not book  this tour and avoid exoitcca."
2024-02-05,N/A,Terrible after-sales support,"I would be wary of this company. Their itineraries look good but they do not offer good after sale support at all.They have a 75% cancellation fee if you cancel within two months of your travel date. I injured my leg and I was unable to travel, we lost almost £2000 without so much as an apology. Abysmal."
2024-02-05,N/A,Terrible customer service!,"Terrible customer service!! We booked a trip with no issues, excellent service. We have tried numerous times now to amend some tours and add extras to our trip but nobody answers the phone or any emails!! It is impossible to speak to anyone! We will end up booking separate trips and not bothering with anything that Exoticca provide."
2024-02-05,N/A,Cant Reach Customer Service,My trip is approaching.  I am unable to view my trip itinerary on their website.  It shows that I have no upcoming trip.  I called customer service and have been on hold now for 30 minutes and not one live person has responded.  This never occurred during the booking process.  I was able to reach someone without waiting.  I'm not sure why my after-purchase experience would differ.  This makes me nervous that if a problem should arise during travel if I will be able to reach someone in a timely fashion or even at all.  I would like for someone to call me ASAP!!!Still on hold now for 1 hour and 20 min.  Just received an automated message that stated sorry for the wait and then the call was disconnected.  Very Poor Customer Service.
2024-02-05,N/A,Impossible customer service…,"Impossible to reach customer service with questions. Period. Call back, if any, is 2 days later. Strongly recommend NOT using this company if this is your first time as you will be disappointed, unless you like drama in your life."
2024-02-04,N/A,To Exoticca;,"To Exoticca;Thank you for contacting me after our trip; however, I really needed you to contact me before the trip; here is why:After booking our family trip on line, there was a huge mistake with my daughters returning flight.  We all booked the same direct flights to make our trip safe and more enjoyable.  I personally booked my daughter on the phone, and, I specifically mention to Agent it was imperative we had the same flights, hotels and Itineraries as we were traveling as a group of five with our friends.  However, my daughter was assigned a non-direct returning flight from Lima to Los Angeles. She was assigned to a flight with a stop in Atlanta on the way to LA, with a total different time of departure and arriving in LA the next morning, now why will anybody do that to a family traveling together?????After multiple frustrating attempts to have this corrected by talking to numerous agents that never took care of the situation, we had no choice but to contact the airlines directly, which in turn, due to Exoticca’s mistake, costed us an extra $549.00 dollars to get her on the correct direct return flight to LA.As you can understand, the situation put us all on a non-positive disposition with the Exotica trip booking.   The company puts out very good deals, but is not able to back them up accordingly when there is negligence on their part.  Every time we called in reference to the issue we got diverted to a different agent that had to contact a supervisor, and when we asked to talk directly to a supervisor, we were denied the request. We were told that someone will review the recorded phone call in order to see if there was a mistake but unfortunately they listened to the wrong recording and never got to the correct one, with the correct time, correct phone number and correct name.Based on all the inconsistencies with Exoticca Travel dealing with our situation, I think it exposed the company's lack of responsibility to costumers that in terms exposes travelers to deal with a company that displays no liability over potential booking mistakes as we never got our problem solved.   Management, if there is any, lacks the ability to better serve customers. We are extremely disappointed with Exoticca booking.  The situation was completely avoidable if the booking was done correctly at the beginning by using good work ethics.There were also some problems with the domestic flights scheduling during the trip.  The Hotels were basic and the rooms were so small that 2 people were a crowd inside.  On three out of four hotels there was no air conditioning in the rooms and they felt suffocating unless you open the one window to the street that was extremely loud with traffic and horns beeping.   The only charming hotel was Agustos, Urubamba, very pleasant.  One more positive, with the experience, was the majority of Condor Travel members, representatives and guides were very kind, helpful and on time with the scheduling.  Kudos go to them as a separate company, they made the trip much better with their professional disposition.At the end of the trip we are thankful to return home safe as a family, on the same direct flight, even considering it cost us more money.  Needless to say I will not recommend Exoticca to friends and family after our experience and will post our disappointment with our social media followers.  I give Exoticca a 2, star rating; it needs a lot of improvement with Public Relations.Sincerely,Marina"
2024-02-03,N/A,I'm trying to contact Exoticca today…,I'm trying to contact Exoticca today about my trip to Ethiopia tomorrow no reply to calls and also the facility to leave messages via their website is not working. This is despite their promise of 24/7 support?I'm really concerned that as a solo female traveller I will not able to contact them if I need help. Very quick to accept payments but unhelpful after that. Not impressed!
2024-02-02,N/A,Unsubscribe,Unsubscribe. Bad ads . Too many ads. Stop this.
2024-02-02,N/A,Very unorganized! No compensation for errors.,"This is my 2nd trip with Exoticca and it was far from my first experience.  We took the 8day France tour to Paris and Nice.  Flight times were good.  Hotels were fine.  The Local rep did not do her job.  We were issued a hop on hop off ticket in Paris that did not allow for hopping off, only slotted time to do the loop.  Then we were charged for our breakfasts.  Our local rep never followed up to confirm the next stop, transfer etc (as was stated would happen via text at each step) We had to get in contact with her, which was difficult to say the least.  Upon requesting refunds, we went back and forth during and after the trip for 2 weeks.  We did get a refund for the hop on ticket and breakfasts, but no compensation at all for lost attractions in Paris or for time spent on our vacation (which was alot of time) trying to find out if the next step was going to happen.  Needless to say, I would never recommend this trip to anyone.  Customer service was poor, unorganized.  Very very disappointed.."
2024-01-31,N/A,Exoticca is a BAIT AND SWITCH…,Exoticca is a BAIT AND SWITCH OPERATION!! Their customer service is non existent aftre you book a reservation. NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE! Try putting their charges in dispute and get the corporate line of their horrible terms and conditions. They have my moeny today but I will fight until the end to get it back..

2024-01-31,N/A,ecent experience with Excticca was a nightmare...,"My recent experience with Exoticca has been nothing short of a catastrophic travel nightmare, marked by an astonishing lack of competence and a complete disregard for customer well-being. The litany of issues we encountered from the very beginning to the end of our journey is not just disheartening but downright unacceptable.Stranded in Tokyo: The nightmare commenced with the guided tour in Tokyo, where a group of eight individuals, including us, were left stranded at the designated meeting spot. Despite countless attempts to contact Exoticca for assistance and an alternative tour, our pleas fell on deaf ears. The frustration and helplessness we felt were exacerbated by the utter lack of response from your team. Our file, laden with records of numerous futile calls, stands as a testament to your deplorable customer service.Hotel Confusion in Osaka: The hotel debacle indicated on our booking app resulted in a significant delay of four hours in Osaka. The sheer incompetence displayed by Exoticca, where the assigned hotel differed from the one specified on our app, is inexcusable. This delay disrupted our plans and cast a shadow over our entire trip.Unsafe Accommodation in Bangkok: Our stay in the hotel located in Bangkok's red-light district was nothing short of a horror show. Navigating through unsafe alleys, being followed by suspicious individuals, and witnessing rats around the hotel premises added an unnerving dimension to our stay. Despite specifically requesting two beds during the reservation, this detail was overlooked, leading to an unpleasant experience from the very start. Only four out of the booked hotels managed to accommodate our basic requirements.Flight Mismanagement: The mismanagement extended to our flights, as Exoticca's reservation led to exorbitant charges for additional baggage. Unable to request the extra bag online due to your agency booking the flight, we were left with no choice but to add it at the airport, where the cost tripled. The same deceitful tactics were employed on our flight from Bangkok to Phuket, resulting in overcharges for checked luggage. Shockingly, another couple on our flight, Ashley and Ray Afshar, had the same distressing experience.Unhygienic Accommodations in Phuket: The most distressing aspect of our ordeal was the condition of the accommodations in Phuket, where we discovered dirty sheets in our hotel room. This egregious oversight left us feeling uncomfortable, disappointed, and questioning the significant investment we made in this vacation.Booking Agent's Mistake: Adding insult to injury, the booking agent had our reservation under the incorrect name, further complicating hotel and flight check-ins. This careless error showcases a level of incompetence and disregard for basic details that is simply unfathomable.In conclusion, our journey with Exoticca has been a harrowing experience, tainted by incompetence, deception, and a shocking lack of concern for the well-being of your customers. I strongly caution anyone considering your services to think twice before entrusting their travel dreams to a company that has demonstrated such a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction."
2024-01-31,N/A,No accountability or compassion,"I wish I could comment on how wonderful my trip to Jordan and Egypt were, but I never got there.  When I booked my trip last May, I carefully reviewed my itinerary to make sure everything was in order.  Visa's would be covered and all I would have to do is pay $25 when I arrived in Egypt.  I got all of my doctor recommended vaccinations. Booked my flight to Toronto where I would be flying from.  Made all my arrangements.  Packed my bags.  Then I 'accidentally' discovered 3 days before my departure that the Visa requirements had changed for Egypt last October.  There had been no notification of a change to my itinerary.  I was doing a final review of my paperwork when I noticed a wording change that destroyed all of my plans.  I now had to get a Visa on my own from the Egyptian Embassy.  As a Canadian I was no longer able to get an e-Visa but would have to apply with the embassy which would require 15-20 business days at the least.  This was my first trip with Exoticca and I had chosen them last May after diligently doing my research.  I understand completely that I bear some responsibility but I had even emailed Exoticca on October 18th to check on the tour due to the Israel/Hamas war.  They emailed me back on October 20th stating that they were keeping an eye on the situation but that everything was good to go.  If there were any changes to my itinerary they would let me know.  As far as I am concerned, they did not keep up their end.  How often was I supposed to read the fine print of the itinerary.  They don't even send an update, they just changed the on-line document and left it for me to discover.  Needless to say, I had to cancel.  I have been told I will get 25% back but that is totally unsatisfactory.  Where is their due diligence and accountability?  They had the information.  How difficult would it have been to notify their traveler? This is totally unacceptable. This trip was a life long dream and took a good chunk of my savings. All it would have taken was a notification that my itinerary had changed and for me to review the details.  I don't think that would have been too much to ask.Once again, they do not get my point so that means nothing will change for future travelers.  I indicated that the small print in the itinerary changed, BUT the issue is there was nothing that flagged me to have a look.  I have a copy of the original itinerary that said the Visa would be provided at the time of arrival for a $25 fee.  However, that was changed in the on-line itinerary with no notification.  So I realize it was changed.  MY ISSUE IS THAT THERE WAS NO NOTIFICATION THAT 5 MONTHS AFTER I BOOKED MY TRIP IT HAD CHANGED.  Is there no accountability on the part of Exoticca?"
2024-01-31,N/A,"Decent travel agency, awful new default payment option","*canned response from the company is not helpful. I put in more than enough details about the issues.**company response is nonsense. As a consumer protection expert in banking. This  method does not protection customers nor is more secure than a credit card. The company is limiting the payment options for their our convenience and financial benefit.Been on two other tours with them (South America and Turkey) and soon a third. I find them to be fairly priced. Hotel selections were far from the city centers. Local tour companies were subcontracted and pretty standards. Extras are also subcontracted and generally cost more than if you found them directly on TripAdvisor.The wait for sales agent is quick but tried to contact a customer service agent after purchase was unsuccessful even after two calls of waiting for 25 mins and it states a recorded message that they are busy and hangs up. Upgrade your system so customers get a call back!The main complaint going forward is on December 28, 2023 is their decision to make bank transfer as default payment. It is  quite complicated for the average consumer and will deter others from using this travel agency again. Instructions for payment are unclear and you just provide information about the company and the company’s bank. There is no way to transfer money without paying a wire transfer fee or the other option is to have the US banks cut a physical check to your company’s address in Connecticut. These are not good options. Exoticca needs to setup a payment portal where customers can enter their own bank information and account to provide you payment like other companies that want to avoid their customers from using credit cards. Do better! It will deter many from reusing Exoticca."
2025-03-18,N/A,Sad and uncaring,"Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil ""tour""Having used Exoticca before we were confident that this was a good choice, we were wrong.Bad organisation, some shockingly bad hotels, massive groups of mixed nationalities, strange check-in options and early flights.  I could go off on one but I'm frankly sick of talking about how crap they were this time and their ""customer support"" is almost robotic.  I won't book another trip with them.  Sad, sad, sad 😢 They've obviously gotten too big and don't give a crap about the customers anymore."
2024-01-26,N/A,DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!!,DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!!! Have a trip in November 2024! Have flights booked wanting to upgrade but the type of ticket booked by exoticca prohibit for any upgrade at all. Can’t even pick seat it comes with extra cost or until check in of flights.They take forever to answer call. Wanted to know if it was ok one of our party wanting to travel 1-2 days early and fly back way later to extend his trip. He will be paying out of pocket. No answer all given is a threat you booking will be cancelled. Also super RUDE!!!Can’t even cancel due to will lose deposit. ($5000). If we can’t get any info guess will just dispute with our credit card.
2024-01-25,N/A,Exoticca is selling trips to Egypt to…,"Exoticca is selling trips to Egypt to Canadians and Egypt is playing games with Visas, and then it works really well for Exoticca because without visas you cannot go and Exoticca pockets 75% of your money with no possibility of a trip. They are hiding behind the clause saying that visas are customer responsability, you cannot apply for a visa without a departure date and info and the link Exoticca had on their site is outdated..so you have to travel to the Embassy Ottawa or Montreal to apply, and with our conversations with others Egypt is playing hard ball due to travel restrictions being imposed on them from Canada, the customers then becomes the pawn and Exoticca is laughing all the way to the bank with your money..and don’t think you can switch to another destination because they simply will not flex. Buyer beware !"
2024-01-25,N/A,We just lost ~$2600 on a trip to…,"We just lost ~$2600 on a trip to Ecuador by trusting this agency. Our destination,  Ecuador, days before our trip, declares a “state of emergency” with curfews at night due to safety concerns. All over the news are videos of open warfare in the streets where even the police don’t feel safe. 2 of our destinations were “hotspots” for this violence. Even our tour guides changed walking tours to car rides!  Exoticca is like “we care about your safety” but we’re holding the trip and if you don’t like it, 25% *which we were entitled +a measly $99 of our money back, that’s it. Say what? There a government “state of emergency” declared 7 days before trip? Their answer “our partners say it’s safe.”  We are told travel insurance would not cover. This is a bad look for Exottica, and yes a bad look for Ecuador hotels/airlines who should have done the right thing. We will never travel there now and will recommend others we know also cross this off their list.If you can risk the cost of your trip then by all means, choose this travel agency. If not, look elsewhere!"
2024-01-24,N/A,Useless contact service,Take 20 minutes to answer then can't help or try to pass you to someone else... Who doesn't answer!!!
2024-01-24,N/A,GROUP TOURS!!! BEYOND MY UNDERSTANDING,"Exoticca supposedly offers ""GROUP TOURS"". BEWARE! The travel coordinator  who is supposed to provide guidance and help is not accessible even after Exoticca shared the mobile number.  HE says I am only a Emergency Support, and does not reply to my messages. SEE the  automatic message below.Then, who is the travel coordinator who will guide us and help us with local optional bookings?  NO ONE, I BELIEVE!We dont know the other members of the group, cant reach to the so called ""TOUR DIRECTOR"",You call it a GROUP TOUR. Beyond my understanding!!!!If you are looking for the company of fellow travelers or local knowledgeable person, BEWARE, 'GROUP TOURS"" are a SHAM and FRONT.

2024-01-24,N/A,Exoticca mess up for the last time,I was on a Muslim diet. I said I  don't eat pork. Then we got to the hotel and my name is not on the reservation list.I  also noticed that I was charged for a canceled reservation on my cc.
2024-01-23,N/A,Sales Agent's Booking Mistake but Exoticca didn't give customer refund,"I made two reservations for my family to go to Italy, the first trip my husband booked online, and the 2nd trip I called Exoticca and asked the sales agent to booked the exact same trip for my other family members as my first online booking. After I made the payment I found out they are in different hotel category. I called the customer services several times to request the correction, After a week I got an email saying that I already confirmed the trip, the only way is to cancel the trip and make the new reservation. I lost all my 20% deposit when I cancel it and Exoticca didn't offer any refund, even it's their sales agent's mistake. Think about it, how I can confirmed the trip if I know there is a different hotel for my whole family? Especially I emphasized more than once to the sales agent I need the exact same trip info. as my previous booking! Very disappointed! Exoticca only wants to earn money, and it doesn't care about customer's need. We won't use it any more."
2024-01-23,N/A,I booked a trip on Exoticca,I booked a trip on Exoticca. Peter was very helpful but no where on the site did it reference they only take payment by wire after the first deposit. This is false advertisement. Other travel companies are easier to work with.  They do not make you do a wire or incur bank charges to do said wire. Other companies accept credit card payment or ach link. You would think a company that has been in business a long time would have better methods.  They really make it inconvenient for their customers to pay them or build points with their credit card companies.
2024-01-23,N/A,Don’t book with them,Be very careful of this company’s cancellation policy. I booked at 9pm one evening and the read all the negative reviews on sites other than trustpilot. I tried to cancel the next morning first thing but was told I would have to pay 60% of the cost of the holiday which was £1600……outrageous!! Nothing I can do as it’s in their terms and conditions but completely unreasonable. I do blame myself but thought that as normally you are covered by the change of mind laws I thought I was safe enough. Apparently not the case where flights are involved
2024-01-22,N/A,Rip Off. No support. Broken promises. AVOID!,"Booked a special holiday to Costa Rica. Of the five main hotels shown (... or similar), we only had one. Others were OK but two (6 nights) were substandard and much inferior to those shown as the likely hotel. I accept that there may be changes but they were too many and the replacements were not similar to. Instead of a mountain hotel with pools and spa next to the national park. We were in a pokey hotel with nothing. Instead of a fabulous hotel overlooking the ocean, we had what looked and felt like a 2star Benidorm hotel.I checked up and the hotels provided were on average over £100 per night cheaper than those we expected.Accommodation was allocated at the last minute which interferes with planning and reviewing hotels.Exoticca provide 24/7 message contact but were useless and unhelpful when seeking help. They were ignorant, dismissive and lying. They left us stranded without help and refused to escalate our complaints. This was the single most worrying aspect that, if you are in need of help  They will hide away in Barcelona.I gave them a chance to rectify things before reviewing but they have covered their tracks, failed to show any empathy and offered vouchers off another holiday with them. I won't go with them. They are cowboys."
2024-01-21,N/A,5 people have cold called me since I…,5 people have cold called me since I booked asking me to book a holiday.Vin Mark and Craig have not responded to 3 emails I sent asking a couple of questionsWhy is non realistic baggage allowance or details on extortionate add on cost available on booking ???
2024-01-21,N/A,I have already sent several emails…,I have already sent several emails expressing my concerns with both booking and paying for my next trip.
2024-01-21,N/A,I sent my survey about the issues of…,"I sent my survey about the issues of the Egypt trip last year and requested Sandra, Head of customer experience to contact me for further details, but never received her email.  They are good to sell you the trips but never care about the after sale service.  Bureacrat."
2024-01-21,N/A,Trying to get any sort of communication…,"Trying to get any sort of communication via email or a call back after you have booked is impossible!  Very very frustrating. After a week and three email, finally got one in return. My request via the website resulted in messages left again day later about “my interest in booking a trip”. No, not at all. I have booked a trip and need further help and I cannot get any."
2024-01-20,N/A,Great Pyramids & Full-Board Nile Cruise,"Overall, I rate Exoticca - 2.Everything is done as cheaply as possible; there is no proactivity, communication, options, nor advice. Customer service is a contact centre in the Philippines.Review:We have just come back from our Exoticca “Great Pyramids & Full-Board Nile Cruise” trip. Overall, the trip was fantastic, amazing, but that is simply because of the spectacular splendour of Ancient Egypt. My review of Exoticca isn’t as glowing.We booked the trip and included the 4 optional tours. The website isn’t smart enough to prevent you from booking the additional tours independently as well as the bundle, so I mistakenly booked both… they never contacted me to correct it, but they refunded me immediately (10 working days) when I worked it out and contacted them. Other advice when booking is to carefully select the flight as most have no luggage allowance or have multiple connections. I selected BA and was able to add luggage and upgrade the flight with Avios by myself.We flew to Cairo early on the Thursday morning and were met at the airport and transferred to the hotel and got there at 6pm (that's a whole day - this day is just transit.). We were told they would meet us at 3am for the transfer to the airport for the flight to Aswan in the morning. The hotel (Conrad) was dirty and noisy.We joined 13 other people in the hotel lobby the next morning, who already seemed to know each other. We were given breakfast packs (mainly bread and a banana) and taken to the airport. We flew to Aswan and were met by our guide. We were put on a bus to Aswan Dam and were allowed off to take pictures (not much to take) and then were shuttled to a perfume/oil shop, then on to a spice shop… these were all “kick-back” type sales gimmicks. We then went to see the “unfinished obelisk” which took about 30 minutes (significantly less time than the previous two), and finally were taken to the boat at about 3pm – that’s a long day on the “luxury” breakfast. I do feel that we could have had a much later flight and skipped the perfumery and spice shop.The boat cruise was fabulous. It was noisy, but that’s probably because we were in bed at 9pm almost every night because of the early starts. If you are considering booking, you need to know that you will wake up at 3am almost every day. The latest we woke up was 4:45 am apart from the last day in Cairo – 7am. The buffet on the boat was very good – excellent selection of food.The next morning we were up at 3am again to go to Abu Simbel… are you seeing a trend? Apparently, this is so that we could be back in time for the boat’s departure… it was worth it to be there that early because it was relatively quiet. Abu Simbel is spectacular. The next days was the 4:45 am to Edfu. We also did the optional balloon ride, which was worth the 3:30 am start.The flight back to Cairo was another early start, but it also meant we go to the pyramids very early (early is good, because it means fewer tourists). It was a long day though and we only got to our hotel at 2:30pm.So – a LOT of early starts!All of our reps and transfers were done by “Planet Tours”. Our guide was OK, but he didn’t “guide” us in many of the temples (he gave us an overview on the bus before we arrived). Many people on our tour made comments about this, as other tour guides took their people into the temples and showed them things. Our guide took us into one temple (Luxor), but it was a rush and a race through.My biggest problem comes with the way Exoticca book these tours and their customer service:Because we booked the upgraded tour (Luxury 3N Cruise) we flew to Aswan with a group who had already been to the pyramids and had spent an evening together in Cairo. This also meant that we had to join a different group at the end of the tour, for our Cairo jaunt. This is weird as groups tend to form a dynamic and friendships in the short week together, so we were the “outsiders” on both occasions. The other problem is that the travel reps don’t communicate so we ended up with our suitcase getting lost (when we changed groups), even though I check and confirmed with the tour guides 4 times! We had nothing to change into (after being on a camel, you really want to), and our rep couldn’t have cared less. Our suitcase as found and brought back to us at 7pm. We couldn’t even check into the hotel until 3pm anyway.To say, Exoticca could not have cared less, is an understatement!! We attempted to get help for most of the afternoon with no update. This was our single day off for the entire trip, with no clean clothes, so we couldn’t even do anything. Exoticca did nothing and would help (still will not!)Advice to Exoticca: Keep the same people on a single tour. It makes it easier for everyone. If that wont work, at least give people the option to change or cancel.MUST do:Abu SimbelTemple of CarnacBalloon rideDon’t Do:Nubian ExperienceLight Show"
2024-01-19,N/A,Very poor customer service.,"I am very unhappy because I am flying to Egypt with this company next week, and I had some questions I needed answered. For 3 days in a row I have tried phoning their customer helpline, and each time I was waiting over 40 minutes and no agent answered. I sent an email through their website and got a standard response, with the same phone number I had already unsuccessfully used. After 2 days, no-one had got back to me on the email, so I tried again. No response. When I replied I got a standard reply IN SPANISH with a phone number in SPAIN. I tried that number, and there was no option for English and the person spoke too quickly for my basic Spanish. This company seems to abandon you once they have your money. It's not too bad when you actually get to your destination, but this lack of customer care creates unnecessary stress in the lead up to your trip. The same thing happened last year when I took a trip to Peru with them. They need to employ more customer service staff."
2024-01-19,N/A,Do Not Use,"When I arrived to Johannesburg, I got extremely sick. No one from Exoticca cared to help or do anything for me until I got to Cape Town where I got worse and ended up in the ER with absolutely no help, once again. I ended up cutting my trip short once the hospital cleared me. When I arrived back in the US, I reached out to them for any kind of help, they denied me. Even with insurance, I received no help from them. So if you somehow get sick on your trip like I did... GOOD LUCK GETTING HELP. Now it makes sense why they're prices are so cheap... they carry no liabilities for their passengers."
2024-01-18,N/A,😡❌ Customer service issue and inaccurate reservations given 😡,"This is one of the first times I have given a 1 star review to any company but I am extremely upset and frustrated with Exoticca.com and the lack of help they have provided even after I tried to resolve the issue but received no help, just a sorry for the mistake of our customer service rep and inaccurate details on their own company app.  As well as the difficulty of getting through to their customer service dept that took 3 days to reach on the phone after being automatically disconnected after 30 minutes on hold because no customer service reps were available and there was no auto call back option / feature.Due to the lack of reliability and inaccurate information from Exoticca employee, their website and app we lost almost $500 which they refused to help with or make any accommodation changes to fix the problem.   I used Exoticca.com to book a vacation for our group of 4 people almost two months ago to go to Cartagena Columbia and literally two weeks before we are suppose to leave they switched our hotel to a different hotel without informing us. Even though their employee, website and app all stated and confirmed we were staying at Hotel Dann Cartagena a month ago.  I called Exoticca over a month ago to CONFIRM our hotel accommodations because we had other friends joining us for our vacation in Columbia and they were booking the hotel portion on their own to be with us and spend time with us at the hotel, pool, etc.  They booked at the same hotel we were confirmed at and paid almost $500 which was non-refundable.  Then two weeks before we are supposed to leave I get an email from Exoticca travel agency that they switched our hotel at the last minute and said their employee made a mistake confirming our hotel a month ago and their website and app were also wrong in showing our hotel because they have the RIGHT to switch your reservation up until 14 days before leaving because that’s when they confirm it.  If you have other family meeting you or really like a hotel they book you in, they can outright change the hotel without even informing you even if you already made plans around your original hotel accommodations they said you have.  I find this to be very disturbing, upsetting and not reliable especially when they refused to switch us back to the original hotel that has rooms available and was verbally and in writing confirmed to us !! They also refused to provide an additional room for our friend at the hotel they unexpectedly switched us to and refused to offer any credit back to us even though this new hotel has a lower rating, more negative reviews, and no balconies in the room and my childhood friend that we wanted to spend time together is now stuck at the other hotel all by himself because he can’t cancel his reservation there. He now has to spend another $500 to double book to a new hotel that Exoticca has switched us to. I am extremely frustrated and have lost out on many hours of time waiting on hold with Exoticca, contacting both hotels, with no help provided.This mistake and problem was 100% Exoticca’s fault for confirming our hotel accommodation with us even when I specifically called their customer service to confirm and explain our situation because other people were booking same hotel so we can vacation together.  By Exoticca showing our hotel details on their app under the hotel section even though the hotel was not booked or confirmed yet !! So essentially we lost out on almost $500 and received NO HELP from Exoticca besides a sorry about their mistake their employee made and we will let management know ( the same management that is not available to speak with and is not allowed to communicate or talk directly with their customers) !!If you want reliable airline and hotel reservations for your vacation then STAY AWAY from this company because they offer no assistance or refund / credits back if they change it on you literally two weeks before you are suppose to leave on your vacation ! I am a frequent traveler and I will NEVER be using them again besides a second trip that I unfortunately already have booked with them for October 2024."
2024-01-18,N/A,I have traveled with Exoticca…,"I have traveled with Exoticca frequently, and some screw up surfaces every time. The prices are low, which makes travel affordable, but even expert travelers must stay on guard every minute of any transaction with Exoticca. This gets old and sends experienced people to other, more expensive tour companies just for peace of mind. I try to think of them realistically--as a broker of basic trips. I do all the homework necessary to adjust to the inevitable issues that arise in foreign travel. This way, I am less vulnerable to exoticca's FU attitude when they pull something outrageous."
2024-01-18,N/A,Customer support very frustrating,"I have used Exoticca twice already.  Both trips were good.  Very concerning though once something goes wrong on a planned trip. Customer support was slow to help. It was stressful and frustrating.  Agents could not make decisions without proper approval from the ""travel team"". If you have issues that needed to be resolved over the weekend, good luck on that because we were in limbo for 3 days waiting for our ""escalated"" questions to get answered.  Their ""travel team"" aka supervisors have weekends off I'm assuming.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, this is what the agent literally wrote ""According to company policy, supervisors are not permitted to take calls or communicate via whatsApp.""  WTH! We had a planned trip to Ecuador, unfortunately the country was in chaos when the President declared a state of emergency.Exoticca agents over the weekend kept escalating our concerns whether to cancel the trip or not.  Finally got a response early Monday (our trip departs Monday night). I no longer trust this company. What if an issue happens when we’re in the middle of our trip so far away from home?"
2024-01-18,N/A,I left 2 messages a week ago & no…,I left 2 messages a week ago & no respondI made my down payment for my trip & I paid more than I should & they wanted the rest of 10 days laterWhat??I was told to pay the rest of it 30/60 days before the trip
2024-01-18,N/A,Options on trips given not on seating or luggage…,Booking hold luggage has been proving impossible as an aisle seat . Response to enquiries todate non existent
2024-01-18,N/A,Disappointed with the agent,"We took a trip with Exoticca to Peru, and had enjoyed it very much.  We were hoping to have a long-term relationship with the tour operator.  However, our recent booking experience with them has been very disappointing.We had a voucher from our last trip.  The agent promised us that she would honor it even if it expired.  (When I first spoke with her, the voucher had not expired, but it was before Christmas and I was told they were extremely busy, so she said not to   worry about the upcoming expiration of the voucher.) In addition, I was told that I, as well as the friend that I referred to Exoticca, would each get a discount for my referral.  But about a week or two later when we wanted to book a trip, she started to tell us that we couldn't use them at the same time, and that she couldn't give us much more discount, etc. After a long conversation, she said she would check with her supervisor, and would get back to us in an hour.  However, she never did.   Even though we called her several times, and left several messages, we never heard from her.It is unprofessional and a dishonor for a travel agent not to honor their commitment.  We have been extremely disappointed by the Exoticca agent.  Now I am wondering if it will happen again should we decide to book a trip with Exoticca in the future."
2024-01-18,N/A,$700 voucher becomes $500,Horrible experience with FLORENCE & MIKA. These agents just want your money & make empty promises. I lost $200 from my vourcher because they never called back to complete the booking. HORRIBLE!!!
2024-01-17,N/A,URGENT: TRIP IS ONE DAY AWAY...STILL WAITING FOR HELP,"Frequent traveler who has never encountered this level of incompetency with a travel agency.  Flights were just changed again with a 5 1/2 layover in Panama. We paid extra for flights with shorter layovers. Previous flight change had a 24 hr. layover in Panama.  Where is the quality control?  Travel Itineraries are lacking correct information and are never up to date.  Customer Service and CS Escalation Team refuse to help and have advised that we must await an email with other flights options if available.With this horrible experience thus far, I can only imagine the nightmare of a trip to a foreign country through Exoticca!"
2024-01-17,N/A,Respond someone PLEASE,Does anyone answer the phone at this company?We have been emailing and calling without a response for a month now.  On hold for usually 40 minutes each time before I give up.
2024-01-17,N/A,I have not yet traveled with this…,"I have not yet traveled with this company. I’m hoping my travel insurance will allow me to cancel-I tried several times to call Exoticca only to be put on hold for over 40 minutes each time! I finally waited it out the third time- it took 46 minutes for them to finally answer me and then would not answer my simple question as I had booked the vacation through a travel agency!In between phone calls, I used the Exoticca website and asked for them to call me instead- no one ever did!I finally got the email address of one of their reps and sent a message about the horrible customer service. She sent a message back to me, copied in the travel advisor I had originally used and told me all communication had to go through the travel advisor! The Exoticca rep would not even respond to my complaints!!! Unbelievable!My vacation is supposed to be in 3 months but as stated- I hope it can be cancelled! I do NOT want to use this company!"
2024-01-16,N/A,Re previous post 24th October Treasures of Anatolia,"With regard to my previous post on 24th October re Treasures of Anatolia, We were given £400 into our Exoticca wallet to use on future tours as compensation for the issue we encountered in Troy, However due to current health issues we are not ina position to book any trips at present and on the 31st December Exoticca removed the £400 compensation from our Exoticca wallet ! Very underhand and unprofessional and does not inspire confidence in the company"
2024-01-17,N/A,Horrid refund policy,"The good - Exoticca canceled a 1/12/2024 Ecuador trip because of the civil unrest in the country and the danger to visitors at this time.The bad - the trip price tag was $4523, and they refunded $3897 as ""only"" trip credit. I can't even book the same trip for what they credited. Additionally, they will only give trip credit even though THEY canceled the trip. Read the fine print folks, or better yet, book with someone else.In response to Exoticca's reply - Check the US Department of State's status for Ecuador. They have not changed their rating for the country since last year; it's NOT ""reconsider travel"" NOR ""do not travel"" it's ""exercise increased caution"". You made a decision based on safety of your personnel and travelers, which I respect and appreciate. There is NOT a war going on in Ecuador, and invoking “Force Majeure” is a questionable position. I stand by my prior impression of your refund."
2024-01-16,N/A,Don't book with this company,"Don't book with this company. I am scheduled to depart for Ecuador on 1/19. Only today did I receive any communication about the recent safety concerns going on in Ecuador right now, other than a canned message that states they are ""currently monitoring conditions."" While most areas are relatively under control, one city we are expected to visit is under intense military activity, as a know drug cartel kingpin has escaped prison and recently his gang took over a local TV station and held the employees hostage. Today, I finally received an email, not a phone call, stating that the itinerary is going as planned, mind you with 2 days in this dangerous city, Guayaquil, and the only change is that we will be doing the Guayaquil city tour by car and not ""walking."" They are completely unresponsive. Phone rings and rings. What's APP messaging gives no answers. Now, flight has changed by a day later, cutting the trip short by own day, and Exoticca hasn't even changed the itinerary in the app, by email, or called. Apparently they have no idea, what is going on. I honestly feel like they are hoping people cancel their trips because they pocket 75% of the costs, as opposed to them cancelling and the customer receiving 100% of their cost. Oh and by the way, regardless of the credit amount, it is only awarded in a credit for a future trip, so either way they keep your money. This company is  very calculated and predatory. They have no concern for their customers, only for the money.I am currently waiting for a representative to call me to discuss, but 1) I will be surprised if they do and 2) I am sure they are going to try to keep my money even though they have changed the itinerary by more than 12 hours, which according to their policy would warrant a full travel creditWhile I understand things happen, their blatant disregard for people's lives and lack of communication are not acceptable to me as a business practice.I will be more than happy to amend this review if Exoticca does the right thing and refunds my money, so we'll see what happens..."
2024-01-16,N/A,Buyer beware,"Buyer beware! As a senior, and novice traveler, I made an error booking a trip in 2024 instead of 2025.  I immediately called the next day and was told my cancellation would be “expedited “.  After many emails and cancellations o their website, I come to find out they are keeping my whole deposit ($499.00) as their policy states a percentage of the cost of the whole trip is due, not just a percent of the deposit.   It’s making me sick to think I’m loosing $499.00 in such a simple mistake I tried immediately to correct….beware…"
2024-01-16,N/A,They don’t care out your safety and there agents have as much power or help as a recorded message,"Had a trip planned to Ecuador for four on January 17. Ecuador has an ongoing security crisis, with an all out war between narco gangs and government, which the country is in a 60 day stay of emergency. Talked to an agent who offered that I would just lose airfare. I agreed and cancelled. But then found out their agents can’t do anything. Received an email that there offer is 25 cents credit on the dollar . Called more times they won’t let you talk to any supervisor or manager. The agents feel bad but they have no power. Emailed to talk to a manager and work out an equitable agreement. Only response is take the credit or not . Not even the common decency to answer my safety concerns or a breakdown of there expenses incurred or how they have increased security."
2024-04-02,N/A,"$3,000 Frustrating DIspute with Exoticca Travel","UPDATE March 2024 - Dispute NOT resolved as Exoticca has NOT credited me the almost $1,700 that is legally due to me.Note:  This is a long post because I want to explain thoroughly, because online travel companies are often located overseas and can be VERY hard to deal with.In Septermber., 2023, I signed up for a trip to Ecuador with Exoticca Travel for my spouse and I, that leaves on Feb. 11, 2024.    However, I have come down with a serious Lung Issue that leaves me very short of breath and my lungs aching.  I am in my 5th week and after my hospitalization last week, we are not sure how long this might last.   So, my doctor strongly recommended that since the first city on the tour is Quito, which is at 12,000 feet elevation with very thin oxygen levels that I cancel.SO, I followed EXOTICCA's written policy exactly for cancellation.  I cancelled via email 34 days in advance of the start of the trip.  I had already pre-purchased their ""FLEX"" INSURANCE POLICY that requires a 30 day notification of cancellation in which case they agree to transfer the full cost of the trip (i.e. $3,798) to my Exoticca Wallet for use on a future trip.The next day I had to go into the E.R. when my lung disease problem flared up really bad and I was transferred to the hospital for a few days.I am 71 years old. and I was pretty concerned.The last thing I was worried about was Exoticca Travel leaving me a Voicemail me late in the day on January 11 and telling me that if I didn't contact them ""TODAY"" apparently in the next hour or two before they closed and Re-Confirm my Cancellation,  I would lose 75% of the money that we paid for the Trip.Bear in mind that I was still in the hospital undergoing tests.In short, this 2nd confirmation of my need to cancel our trip made no sense, since it is not mentioned anywhere in their policies.Anyway, when I got out of the hospital on January 12, I heard that voicemail for the first time from an Exoticca rep, Marija. I immediately tried to call them, but had no luck.  I called their 24 hour customer service number (option #2 for cancellation help), and a recording told me to call back the next day and then hung up on me, and gave me no chance to leave a message.So, I sent an email asking them to contact me and explain why they needed me to RE-CONFIRM Cancellation a 2nd time, when on January 7th I already cancelled because of my serious Illness.What was really odd is that my spouse double-checked on January 8th that Exoticca had indeed transferred the full $3,798 into my Exoticca Wallet.So she relaxed, but then later in the week they took away the $3,798 credit completely, and never informed us of this.So, for the last few days I have tried to reason with them but no luck.BUT HERE IS WHAT SHOULD MAKE THEM HONOR THE FULL CREDITUPDATE - Last night Jan 16th, I emailed Exoticca Travel to let them know that I ACTUALLY HAD GIVEN THEM 30 DAYS NOTICE of my need to still cancel.HOW?Well, the month of January has 31 days, so by informing them on January 12th when I got out of the Hospital, I DID give them 30 days notification.In fact I sent them THREE emails on January 12th and clearly confirmed that I ""had to cancel"".In other words, I did comply with their unannounced ridiculous 2nd cancellation step that they have never mentioned anywhere in their written policy. I explained how unfair it was to demand a 2nd cancellation from the customer.SHOULD it not be the customer's responsibility to change their desire to cancel if necessary?  Obviously Exoticca has clear proof that we needed to cancel on JANUARY 7th, so they are legally protected.   It sounded like an ugly ""TRAP"" to me on their part.ANYWAY, it seems to be that they now clearly have no right to withhold any money. Their only reason is that I only gave them 29 DAYS NOTIFICATION that I still wanted to cancel.What I don't understand is that we are new customers and I was very sick in the Hospital.   What kind of cruelty is this?CONCLUSION:  My hope is that this was just the action of an overzealous rep, so  I will give them one last chance to do the right thing.NOTE:  In my emails, I even assured Exoticca that if they honored their Written Policy and transferred the $3,798 back into my Exoticca Wallet, that I would promise to give them credit online for clearing up a dispute.As a backup plan, I did contact my Credit Card company and disputed their action.   My bank has never let me down and since I am a 25 year Plus Credit Card customer, I hope they will come to my rescue if EXOTICCA TRAVEL does not do the right thing.UPDATE Jan 16 - Trust Pilot emailed me that Exoticca is asking for my ECUADOR TRIP BOOKING NUMBER, which I emailed to them.  .This has been very stressful and aggravating, so I hope others are very careful to review all policies carefully, especially with overseas companies."
2024-01-29,N/A,Worst After-Sales Customer Service,"Their customer service is the worst.Craig Haynes is the worst Sales rep.And for customer service- When you call, you will be on hold for a long, long, long time before anyone will come on the phone.You only get them quickly on the phone when you call for a NEW booking.When you send them a message through their website, they take days to respond.And when you reply to them back, there is no follow-through."
2024-01-15,N/A,China. - December 2024,"I have already raised a complaint and taking time to receive a response so was holding off a review until I had a reply but I am no further forward.Failed to deliver what could he a very good product.Cancelled flight 2 hours before departure from airline, Exoticca wanted to charge £350 for change of flights or delay my arrival for 24 hours missing my first full day. I called airline who moved me free of charge to a later flight delaying only by 3 hours arrival. Once Exoticca were informed I passed all new details of flights however transfer was not there as they did not pass this on locally.Beijing had exciting points of interest however these were mostly HARD selling points, where you were sold jade, silk or other items, not cultural experiences as advertised but a shop with a sales assistant being pushy. This really wasted our overall time in China.Xi’an our guide barely spoke English, gave us the wrong information and told us incorrectly what we could do in our free time. Thankfully a savy traveller so did not miss out on things that were told were closed due to season which was by far not true, in fact bustling with tourists. This ruined our Terracotta army experience, once in a lifetime with possibly the worst guide watching other groups going about with their fully competent guides. Most of the group wondered off to read the info plaques as this was more useful.Due to trains booked by Exoticca we had to miss some Shanghai excursion as with Xi’an too meaning you do not have your walking tours included in the time.Overall if you wish to visit China - do it yourself or with another company and pay a little bit extra as my trip unfortunately was full of daily disappointments leading us to do most things independently in the end"
2024-01-14,N/A,I would them 0 if I could,"I would rate them 0 if I could … let’s begin with booking a trip to Ecuador . My mothers trip was booked before the conflict and prison break of a Drug Lord and since then it’s been all out gang war where no one is safe and the country is in a state of emergency… they will not refund or postpone the trip and could care less about their customer safety , for context my mother was planning to see the centre of the world and the islands / wildlife for her 65th birthday and is travelling alone …. Without any concern for their customers safety they refuse to budge in anyway not even a credit … horrible customer service and lack of empathy…. She normally books her own vacations and this time decided to have them take the lead … I for one will never use this company and suggest you also avoid them , there is more accommodating sites out there who value their clients . Stay far away from these crooksEditing this to reply to their reply : regardless of what insurance was added or not , you are well aware of the situation taking place and didn’t even have the decency to postpone it , your reply email was :Please be advised that if you wish to book a different trip we would need to cancel and rebook under terms and conditions.You have the standard cancellation policy which means the penalty is 75% of the total trip amount.If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to contact us.She had to cancel regardless according to your email to her . That’s Horrible customer service , as a business owner myself you should be ashamed the lack of compassion to allow your clients to change the date and still use the services they paid for when the situation is under control over there speaks volumes on how much you truly care about your clients safety …. Again greedy business and horrible business practice . Nothing you can say will change that , and this is not the first review of this kind and won’t be the last either the way you guys operate"
2024-01-13,N/A,Cheap for a reason,"Returned from a 24 day trip to Madagascar exhausted and unwell after a nightmare trip thanks to Exoticca's systematic mis-representation of journey times.All journeys at least 25% longer duration than stated, no meal stops included - only the opportunity to buy snacks at petrol stations. Journeys of up to 13 hours on a non air conditioned coach with a single driver driving continuously.Dangerous and unhealthy.ABTA complaint submitted.The company replies below saying ""they are at our complete disposal"" but over the last month the best they have been able to offer in the way of recompense has been £200 off any future trip with them. Thus, our complaint to ABTA"
2024-01-11,N/A,Harsh treatment by Exoticca,"Exoticca claims on their website to ""treat others how we want to be treated” - sadly, that is not my experience.Within 5 days of making a booking, I realised I had made a mistake and contacted Exoticca requesting an alteration or total/partial refund of my deposit. Their response was:""Services such as your flights are booked immediately upon making the reservation. These services are non-refundable and therefore, non-modifiable. We are unable to offer any refund or travel credit since we have made agreements with our suppliers about when payments will be made, and the cost of penalties depending on cancellation.”As a result, I have lost the entire amount of my £519.60 deposit and feel very harshly treated by Exoticca."
2024-01-10,N/A,Problem even before trip starts,"Unlike what others experienced, my issues began right after booking the trip. Prior to booking, I was assured in writing (email sent on Dec 27) that I could freely choose any optional tour from the list without any conditions. However, the day after booking, I was informed of restrictions on this choice, which contradicts the initial agreement. It's disheartening to see a company retract its promises made in writing to a customer before booking. Despite my attempts to communicate, I received various excuses over the phone, was denied access to speak with the manager, and didn't receive a response to my messages on Facebook messenger.This situation leaves a negative impression even before the trip begins – Itinerary - CA-EX2023219082.I hope we can find a resolution to this matter."
2024-01-09,N/A,***DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY***,"Hi, returning from Italy and finally had time to process my concerns.****DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY****Yet again, they booked our trip over the phone. 2 weeks before we finally got our flight information. Just like so many others, my husband’s name was spelled wrong. I called and told them their error and said it would be corrected. 3 days later I called the airline and it had not! I did tell the airline and they put a note on our account. Luckily no issues.We show up to our hotel after a very long 24 hours to find the hotel closed. Our driver kept us in the van for 1.5 hours with no updates or heat until they figured it out and put us up in a new hotel.Then we paid for a tour to the island of Capril Guess what, being there in the winter on an island they didn’t offer ferries over. How can a tour agency not do their homework like this? Incomprehensible! We were just reimbursed today, but we missed a tour that was advertised!I would like compensation from your company to make it right not a future credit to use with your company because obviously this trip caused us so much anxiety and will never be put through that again!We have used so many tour companies and this was our only issue not one but 3 major ones."
2024-01-06,N/A,PLEASE BE AWARE OF EXOTICCA.,"PLEASE BE AWARE OF EXOTICCA.Egypt Pyramids and Nile Cruise.You will loose all your deposit and full Instalment.If you cancel, they keep deposit and instalment, you will not receive anything back.They will not let you use instalment towards another one of their holidays.They will not let you change dates.They will not let you amend the holiday. For example, you prefer to do the nile cruise and Luxor, but not the Pyramids. They won't let you.If you decide not to go, however you have someone to take your place. THEY WONT ALLOW THIS. They say can't change names on the booking."
2024-01-11,N/A,Waste of time and money - Treasures of Anatolia,"We are still on the holiday but wanted to get this out there straight away, either to deter new customers or for exoticca to respond to our emails and problems that we are having.We are on the treasures of Anatolia trip, and from day 1 we have had issues. Having booked a superior room for me and my family ( with 2 kids of 4 and 6 years old), we were put on the outskirts of Istanbul, which takes over an hour and a half to reach the centre via taxi. The location was absolutely terrible, and not for anyone wanting to actually see the city. Our tour guide (who is actually very good) also informed us it is not  safe location to walk around or travel via public transport and so we were reliant on costly taxis to take us around. The rest of the trip, we have spent approximately 85% of the daylight hours on a coach. We have been constantly rushed to see the sites on the tick list and the best part of the day has been watching kids shows on our mobile phones for our kids. It has been between 6-12 hours on the coach each day. What a ridiculous holiday.Prior to the trip exoticca informed us this would be suitable for young kids, but clearly this much time on a coach is not going to work. The descriptions on the website make it sound fantastic, but no indication at all on the amount of travel required (and I'm unsure if the customer could expect to know or research about this beforehand).We have also had to cancel extra excursions due to it not being suitable for kids, and exoticca have not provided a refund, and we are awaiting a response from them to make this right.We have booked an alternative hotel in Istanbul for end part of the trip (as there are 2 parts of the trip in Istanbul) and requested a refund for the 2 nights for the hotel on the outskirts. Again they have refused to provide a refund on these despite our tour guide saying this was a good idea due to the terrible location.Anyone reading this please be careful with what you book with exoticca, as their customer service is terrible and they will make you feel like you are in the wrong if you have any problems. The travel guides have been very good and we have listened to their instructions in regards to changing hotels and cancelling the excursions, however exoticca have not responded. In all honesty this whole trip feels like a waste of precious time with my family and of course a lot of money.Booking reference incase exoticca want to help. UK - EX2023189615As of 11/01/2024 still nothing back from exoticca despite the response seen below."
